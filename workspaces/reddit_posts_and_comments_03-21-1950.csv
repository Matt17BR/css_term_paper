Our newly published research shows how lightning over shipping lanes dropped by half almost overnight after the regulations went into effect.\n\n  \n[https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/25/2937/2025/](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/25/2937/2025/)', 'comment_score': 158, 'comment_created_utc': 1742575357.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgl88s'}, {'comment_id': 'mj06dm7', 'comment_author': 'series_hybrid', 'comment_body': ""Since carbon soot that rises because it's entrained in hot air is highly conductive, I would suggest that both the metal ship and the carbon soot play a part."", 'comment_score': 23, 'comment_created_utc': 1742576939.0, 'comment_level': 2, 'parent_id': 'mj00tqg', 'post_id': '1jgl88s'}, {'comment_id': 'mj0htoz', 'comment_author': 'Intermountain_west', 'comment_body': ""Yes, the OP is already about the role of exhaust aerosols in lightning.  \n\nI don't see that anyone has said anything about the metal ships being a significant factor."", 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742580165.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'mj06dm7', 'post_id': '1jgl88s'}, {'comment_id': 'mj0i0jr', 'comment_author': 'L1QU1D_ThUND3R', 'comment_body': 'That makes sense.

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00009-1\n\nSummary\n\nChronic pain is a leading cause of disability, affecting more women than men. Different immune cells contribute to this sexual divergence, but the mechanisms, especially in females, are not well defined. We show that pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels on microglia and T cells differentially cause mechanical allodynia, a debilitating symptom of neuropathic pain. In male rodents, Panx1 drives vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) release from microglia. Cell-specific knockdown of microglial Panx1 or pharmacological blockade of the VEGF receptor attenuated allodynia in nerve-injured males. In females, nerve injury increased spinal CD8+ T cells and leptin levels. Leptin release from female-derived CD8+ T cells was Panx1 dependent, and intrathecal leptin-neutralizing antibody injection sex-specifically reversed allodynia. Adoptive transfer of female-derived CD8+ T cells caused robust allodynia, which was prevented by a leptin-neutralizing antibody or leptin small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. Panx1-targeted approaches may alleviate neuropathic pain in both sexes, while T cell- and leptin-directed treatments could have sex-dependent benefits for women.\n\nFrom the linked article:\n\nWhy pain medication may not be as effective for women as it is for men\n\nUCalgary researchers reveal biological differences between the sexes when it comes to chronic pain\n\nA new study led by University of Calgary professor Dr. Tuan Trang, PhD, may help to explain why there is an over-representation of women experiencing chronic pain compared to men. In 2019, the Canadian Pain Task Force report found chronic pain is more common among females of all ages, including children, when compared to males.\n\n“Both males and females develop pain, but each sex develops it through different means,” says Trang, a professor in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and Cumming School of Medicine (CSM). “This study identifies a very unique type of biological process through a specific immune cell that is distinctive to each sex.”\n\nThe study, published in Neuron, focused on neuropathic pain, which is caused by injury to a nerve or the nervous system. A debilitating symptom of this is allodynia which is experienced when someone feels pain from a stimulus that does not typically cause pain. This condition can be very hard to treat; for instance, things like a light touch, temperature changes, and clothing against the skin can be agonizing. The study, conducted in rats and mice, found that in both sexes pain signals can be communicated by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels but through different types of immune cells. In female rodents, however, activation of Panx1 releases leptin, a hormone which has been associated with heightened pain sensitivity.', 'comment_score': 41, 'comment_created_utc': 1742557214.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgerd9'}, {'comment_id': 'miypm4w', 'comment_author': 'Jedi_Outcast_Reborn', 'comment_body': ""Doesn't this indicate that these pain drugs were developed for men, and that we need to invest in better development for drugs for women?"", 'comment_score': 173, 'comment_created_utc': 1742560636.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgerd9'}, {'comment_id': 'mizf3bo', 'comment_author': 'PennilessPirate', 'comment_body': '95% of drugs are developed for men.

In addition to recording the total area covered by all tree clusters, they also identified the proximity and connectedness of tree clusters, their geometrical complexity and the fragmentation level.\n\nThey linked this information with the survival time of the resident in the respective neighbourhood for over six million adults, i.e.\xa0looking exclusively at natural-cause deaths due to illness and old age. This data, supplied by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, covers over a ten-year period (2010–2019). In order to protect privacy, the Federal Statistical Office rounded the coordinates of citizens’ residences to the nearest 50 metres.\n\n**Tree quantity and positioning both matter**\n\nData analysis shows that both the tree canopy cover in residential areas and their spatial arrangement correlate with mortality. The study identified a significantly lower mortality risk in people who live in neighbourhoods with large, contiguous and well networked areas of tree canopies than for people who live in areas with fewer, fragmented areas of tree canopies with complex geometries. This correlation is particularly evident in densely developed peri-urban and urban areas with poor air quality and high temperatures: if such areas feature well-structured forested green spaces, the residents may receive more health benefits than other areas.\n\nYet, while this study represents an important first step, it is still not possible to draw conclusions regarding the causes. The researchers are not yet able to state with precision the pathways through which tree canopy configuration influences human health. Nevertheless, the study’s findings at the individual level are generally consistent with the results of similar studies at the community level in Philadelphia, Tehran and Taipei.\n\nPublication in *The Lancet Planetary Health*:\xa0\n\nDOI: [10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00022-1](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00022-1/fulltext)', 'comment_score': 10, 'comment_created_utc': 1742562518.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jggesv'}, {'comment_id': 'miyzie4', 'comment_author': '99bottlesofbeertoday', 'comment_body': 'AZ resident.

The study found that while male infants tend to have larger total brain volumes, female infants, when adjusted for brain size, have more grey matter, whereas male infants have more white matter. These findings suggest that prenatal biological factors play a significant role in shaping early sex differences in brain structure.\n\nThe findings confirmed that male infants had larger total brain volumes compared to female infants, a pattern that has been consistently reported in older children and adults. However, when researchers adjusted for overall brain size, they found that female infants had significantly more grey matter, while male infants had more white matter.\n\nFurther analysis of specific brain regions showed that, even after accounting for differences in total brain volume, certain areas were larger in female infants, while others were larger in male infants. Female infants had relatively greater volumes in regions such as the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres of the brain, and the parahippocampal gyrus, an area involved in memory processing. Male infants had larger volumes in regions such as the medial and inferior temporal gyri, which are associated with visual and auditory processing.', 'comment_score': 856, 'comment_created_utc': 1742491492.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfu8nz'}, {'comment_id': 'miu7wyl', 'comment_author': 'ishka_uisce', 'comment_body': 'As must be pointed out repeatedly with this sort of research, because people seem incapable of grasping it, these differences are *averages*, and often pretty small.

In a study [published](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347225000314?dgcid=coauthor) February 19 in Animal Behaviour, a team of researchers from the UW and Carnegie Mellon University have discovered the reason: They’re mimicking males. That trickery results in reduced aggression from other hummingbirds and increased access to nectar resources. \n\n“This research takes a mental model we’ve been describing for a while in our papers and gives it a mathematical backbone,” said Jay Falk, an evolutionary biologist who led this research while working as a postdoctoral scholar in the UW biology department. “It can be easy to think of natural selection as a force that is constantly choosing one single optimum. But this model adds to our understanding of how diversity, especially diversity within sexes, can be a stable endgame.” \n\nRelying on the principles of game theory and incorporating previously collected behavioral data, the researchers developed a model of hummingbird behavior to better understand how some birds choose their colors. The findings showed that “hybrid signals” — an equilibrium that can occur when signalers in a given situation may be dishonest — likely exist in nature.  \n\n“In these hummingbirds, females want to mimic males,” said Kevin Zollman, a co-author of the study and director of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Complex Social Dynamics. “If they all did that, then they would end up being disbelieved. So, they end up settling into an equilibrium where some of them ‘lie,’ and they are sometimes ‘believed.’”', 'comment_score': 4, 'comment_created_utc': 1742556466.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgel11'}, {'comment_id': 'miza7ry', 'comment_author': 'The_Humble_Frank', 'comment_body': ""They didn't evolve *to do* anything, there is no aiming in evolution.\n\nThey evolved, and the change in behavior is a consequence."", 'comment_score': 0, 'comment_created_utc': 1742567547.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgel11'}]"

Previous findings suggest citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates are changing because of the patent for citalopram ending as opposed to evidence of a clear therapeutic advantage-so-called ""evergreening"". This retrospective study focuses on characterizing the chronologic and geographic variation in the use of citalopram and escitalopram from 2015 to 2020 among US Medicaid and Medicare patients. We hypothesized that prescription rates of citalopram will decrease with a concurrent increase in escitalopram, consistent with ""evergreening"".\n\n**Methods:**\xa0Citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates and costs per state were obtained from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database and Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data. States\' annual prescription rates outside a 95% confidence interval were considered significantly different from the average.\n\n**Results:**\xa0Overall, a decreasing trend for citalopram and an increasing trend for escitalopram prescription rates were noted in both Medicare and Medicaid patients. The differences between generic and brand were noted for both drugs, with generic forms being less expensive than the brand-name version.\n\n**Discussion:**\xa0Despite limited evidence suggesting that citalopram and escitalopram have any meaningful differences in therapeutic or adverse effects, there exists a noticeable decline in the use of citalopram that cooccurred with an increase in escitalopram prescribing, consistent with our hypothesis. Moreover, among these general pharmacoepidemiologic trends exists significant geographic variability.

To begin, the article is not about widespread public perceptions or presumptions, ostensibly held by many laypeople, about reading behaviors. Rather, the research is concerned with the specific phenomenon of ‘task adaptation,’ studied most often in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and education, and how participants in reading trials gain both momentum AND accuracy through repetition of reading tasks, a conclusion which supports one of the two commonly proposed ‘paradigms’ of task adaptation: learning-based adaptation.\n\nRather than gaining speed and consequently losing accuracy due to some tortured desire to end a trial quicker, which would support the other paradigm (motivation-based adaptation), the research here shows that readers gained speed and accuracy over time as their minds adapted to the task at hand, i.e. reading and recalling specific language within what they’re reading. \n\nAs you can tell, OP’s title suffers from an impulse to oversimplify the subject matter, perhaps because it would be difficult to create a super snappy shorthand for what’s happening in the abstract.\n\ne: Anyone reading this, please correct me if I’m wrong or being redundant – I woke up from a dead sleep, opened Reddit, and this is the first thing I looked at.

The findings suggest – for the first time in a clinical trial – that early treatment to remove amyloid plaques from the brain many years before symptoms arise can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s dementia.\n\nThe study is published March 19 in The Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe international study involved 73 people with rare, inherited genetic mutations that cause the overproduction of amyloid in the brain, all but guaranteeing that they will develop Alzheimer’s disease in middle age. For a subgroup of 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study’s start and who received the drug the longest – an average of eight years – the treatment lowered the risk of developing symptoms from essentially 100% to about 50%, according to a primary analysis of the data and supported by multiple sensitivity analyses supporting the trend. \n\nThe findings provide new evidence to support the so-called amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease, which posits that the first step on the road to dementia is the build-up of amyloid plaques in the brain, and that removing such plaques or blocking their formation can stop symptoms from arising. For this study, Bateman and colleagues evaluated the effects of an experimental anti-amyloid drug to see if the medication could prevent the development of dementia.', 'comment_score': 188, 'comment_created_utc': 1742435634.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfe1zz'}, {'comment_id': 'miqc82r', 'comment_author': 'Last-Initial3927', 'comment_body': 'Hold the phone.

In Romania, where traditional diets are heavily dependent on animal-based products, optimizing land use is critical. This study investigates the potential of plant-based diets to reduce agricultural land use, examining scenarios of partial and complete replacement of animal protein with plant protein sources (soy, peas, and potatoes). Methods: The research modeled three dietary transition scenarios—replacing 33%, 50%, and 100% of animal protein with plant-based protein—using data from the Romanian National Institute of Statistics, the FAO, and international sources. Land use was calculated for each scenario using formulas that take into account protein content and land use intensity for animal and plant protein sources. The simulations quantify the reduction in agricultural land use at the per capita and national levels. Results: The study reveals significant land-saving potential across all scenarios. At the national level, land use reductions ranged from 84,020 hectares (33% replacement) to **1,067,443 hectares** (100% replacement). High-impact products such as beef and dairy continue to dominate land use, even in partial replacement scenarios. Conversely, replacing pork and chicken proteins shows substantial savings. The findings highlight the inefficiency of animal-based protein production and the ecological benefits of transitioning to plant-based diets. Conclusions: **A dietary shift towards plant-based protein in Romania could achieve significant reductions in agricultural land use**, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. This transition not only supports environmental conservation and resource optimization, but also provides public health benefits by reducing consumption of red and processed meat.

Our research is based on the premise that values and beliefs indeed play a major role in political behavior. However, structural features of ideology or belief (and in this case, extremism) may operate similarly across different ideological groups and may sometimes lead to counterintuitive outcomes—potentially even undermining the group’s long-term objectives.”', 'comment_score': 8, 'comment_created_utc': 1742472239.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfna8t'}, {'comment_id': 'mit0wmw', 'comment_author': 'JHMfield', 'comment_body': 'This is me, as I sit on my ass all day:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/NQvTohG', 'comment_score': 3, 'comment_created_utc': 1742483007.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfna8t'}, {'comment_id': 'misv0uo', 'comment_author': 'colinallbets', 'comment_body': 'The article basically describes the road to fascism.

Different areas of the brain are involved in determining the meaning that's desired, finding the words to express it, and then converting those words to a specific series of sounds—and all that comes before the correct sequence of nerve impulses is sent to the muscles that produce the final output. Humans are far from alone in the animal kingdom with an impressive range of vocalizations, though. That raises the prospect that we can understand a bit more about our own speech by studying how vocalization is managed in different animals.\n\nOne group of species that's especially interesting is birds. They're distant relatives compared to other animals with interesting vocal capabilities, like whales and elephants, and their brains have some notable differences from ours. They also show a range of behaviors, from complex songs to vocal mimicry to whatever it is that you want to call what parrots do. Thanks to a newly released study, however, we now have evidence that these different types of vocalization are the product of different control systems in the brain.\n\n[The study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08695-8) relied on electrodes placed in the brains of parrots and songbirds and tracked the behavior of neurons in a region that controls vocalization. It showed that the two relied on different types of control, with parrots having a system that operates similarly to the one used by humans.\n\nThe work focused on two species of birds. One is the zebra finch, a songbird that learns to produce a short song it uses each year, in part by listening to what its peers are singing. The second is the budgerigar, a small parrot that's often kept as a pet. Budgerigars are both impressive vocal mimics and also have complex vocalizations called warbles that are a mix of noisy and harmonic calls.\n\nDue to past work, we've already identified the brain structure that controls the activity of the key vocal organ, the syrinx, located in the bird's throat. The new study, done by Zetian Yang and Michael Long of New York University, managed to place fine electrodes into this area of the brain in both species and track the activity of neurons there while the birds were awake and going about normal activities. This allowed them to associate neural activity with any vocalizations made by the birds. For the budgerigars, they had an average of over 1,000 calls from each of the four birds carrying the implanted electrodes."", 'comment_score': 19, 'comment_created_utc': 1742432892.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfd5cz'}, {'comment_id': 'miqb70m', 'comment_author': 'CornWallacedaGeneral', 'comment_body': 'The mighty parakeet I love these guys!', 'comment_score': 7, 'comment_created_utc': 1742437053.0, 'comment_level': 2, 'parent_id': 'mipz9rj', 'post_id': '1jfd5cz'}, {'comment_id': 'miq86ks', 'comment_author': 'ostuberoes', 'comment_body': 'This write up is much much better than the other one posted earlier in this sub, which is downright shameful.', 'comment_score': 6, 'comment_created_utc': 1742435996.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfd5cz'}]"

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:\n\nhttps://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/02/bmjebm-2024-112974\n\nFrom the linked article: \n\nOnly 10% of non-surgical treatments for back problems kill pain, says review\n\nOnly six out of 56 treatments analysed yielded ‘small’ relief according to most comprehensive worldwide study, with some even increasing pain\n\nMost treatments for back pain do not work and even the few that do bring little relief, a global review of the evidence on one of the world’s commonest health problems has found.\n\nSix in 10 adults in the UK live with lower back pain at some point. Symptoms can include excruciating pain, restricted movement, inability to work and reluctance to mix socially. Some people feel better within weeks but others can find their life dominated by chronic pain for years.\n\nThe wide range of treatment available includes painkillers, acupuncture, stretching, massage, anti-inflammatory drugs, laser and light therapy, and manipulation of the spine.\n\nHowever, the bad news for the many who endure back pain is that only 10% of these non-surgical treatments usually deployed actually have any effect – and the rest provide little or no benefit.\n\nOnly six out of the 56 treatments analysed are effective and even those yield only “small” relief. The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.\n\nThat is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.\n\nAustralian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742376463.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jet0pz'}, {'comment_id': 'milabr4', 'comment_author': 'LifeofTino', 'comment_body': 'Also worth noting that surgical treatments for back issues are also notorious for having a low success rate, with some studies finding surgical treatments to be less successful than non-surgical on average\n\nBack problems were also the canary in the mine around diagnostics. When given blind tests (scan results from past patients), doctors have a low success rate at correctly identifying what the problem was. And, just as famously, lots of scans showed people with significant issues (including bulged discs) that had zero pain, and people with a lot of pain with no diagnosable issues at all\n\nWhich led to diagnostic reforms, because if someone had an issue with something that had no scan indication, and also had something on the scan that wasn’t causing an issue, this would lead to a misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment. Which is partly the cause of such poor results when it comes to back issues\n\nSo, back issues are so well known for having incredibly poor treatment success across all healthcare that they have had major impacts on all therapy and diagnostic practices', 'comment_score': 1343, 'comment_created_utc': 1742377834.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jet0pz'}, {'comment_id': 'milg78r', 'comment_author': 'DangerousTurmeric', 'comment_body': ""Yeah I worked for a company that made spinal cord stimulators, which are basically a battery pack and some electrodes implanted in a person's back to run constant or phased electrical currents, as interference in the spinal cord to numb the pain.

You use the phrase intellectual honesty while misrepresenting the contents of your presented evidence. Aside from that, you have presented evidence in favor of my argument. You have given evidence of a scenario where a political brief was likely used ~~by politicians~~ to influence scientific discourse and scientific agencies (although you presented no evidence that this was actually distributed or used to guide public health agency statements). If my argument is that ""if suppression of scientific evidence is happening, it is more likely being suppressed by politicians and business than the scientists themselves"" and your response is ""you are wrong, here\'s a case where politicians likely tried to suppress scientific agencies or scientific discourse"" then you have failed to demonstrate how I am wrong at all. \n\nI also did not imply that politicians should control research, if anything implied they are the problem. For the record I think scientific agencies should be highly independent and far better funded. My point was that the research itself isn\'t the problem and that suppression or avoidance of actions that should be taken in accordance with those findings are far more often the problem and those things aren\'t the fault of the scientists. If a CDC researcher wants to conduct a large scale study on long term disability as a result of COVID and they are prevented from doing so because the president has stated that they can\'t do more research on that, then the president is the issue, not the scientist who wanted to do the research. In the case of COVID, if a researcher finds damaging long term consequences but that research is suppressed or simply misrepresented or downplayed by politicians, that isn\'t the scientists fault. The researchers in those cases didn\'t kowtow to anybody and your blame is being placed at the wrong place.

You replied to a post where scientists are saying COVID has serious long-term mental impacts. Your reply indicated that you believe scientists are overstating things due to political influence because if they weren\'t there would be more legal measures from regulators on the matter. To that, I pointed out that scientists are far less likely to want to misrepresent the situation than the politicians and businesses who lose out due to those sorts of measures.  Your response to that was a political guidance memo effectively demonstrating how politicians might have an incentive to influence things to downplay not overplay it as you initially claimed.

He cost more North and South Vietnamese lives, along with US troops, to boost his election chances(negotiating with a nation we are at war with outside of government channels is called ""Treason"" btw).

technology,1jgmjaa,Norwegian files complaint after ChatGPT falsely said he had murdered his children,YesNo_Maybe_,40,0.92,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/21/norwegian-files-complaint-after-chatgpt-falsely-said-he-had-murdered-his-children,,1742578483.0,"[{'comment_id': 'mj0chzp', 'comment_author': 'YesNo_Maybe_', 'comment_body': 'The article:\nA Norwegian man has filed a complaint against the company behind ChatGPT after the chatbot falsely claimed he had murdered two of his children.\n\nArve Hjalmar Holmen, a self-described “regular person” with no public profile in Norway, asked ChatGPT for information about himself and received a reply claiming he had killed his own sons.\n\nResponding to the prompt “Who is Arve Hjalmar Holmen?” ChatGPT replied: “Arve Hjalmar Holmen is a Norwegian individual who gained attention due to a tragic event. He was the father of two young boys, aged seven and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.”\n\nThe response went on to claim the case “shocked” the nation and that Holmen received a 21-year prison sentence for murdering both children.\n\nHolmen said in a complaint to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority that the “completely false” story nonetheless contained elements similar to his own life such as his home town, the number of children he has and the age gap between his sons.\n\n“The complainant was deeply troubled by these outputs, which could have harmful effect in his private life, if they where reproduced or somehow leaked in his community or in his home town,” said the complaint, which has been filed by Holmen and Noyb, a digital rights campaign group.\n\nIt added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”.\n\nHolmen’s complaint alleged that ChatGPT’s “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. It has asked the Norwegian watchdog to order ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI, to adjust its model to eliminate inaccurate results relating to Holmen and to impose a fine on the company. Noyb said that since Holmen’s interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.\n\nAI chatbots are prone to producing responses containing false information because they are built on models that predict the next most likely word in a sentence. This can result in factual errors and wild assertions, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking that what they are reading is 100% correct.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we’re still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”', 'comment_score': 10, 'comment_created_utc': 1742578631.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgmjaa'}]"

It was a controversial decision, as many drivers who are in the market for a new vehicle consider CarPlay to be a must-have feature.\n\nLooking to capitalize on the situation, one GM dealership near Detroit, Michigan last year began offering an aftermarket CarPlay installation service in GM’s newer EV models. But, according to a report this week from automotive blog The Drive (via The Verge), GM recently blocked the dealership from offering that service due to safety concerns.\n\n“We have made the difficult decision to discontinue this product,” said the LaFontaine Chevrolet Plymouth dealership, on a website that previously offered the CarPlay installation service. “This was not a decision we made lightly, but due to a variety of factors, continuing to offer this product is no longer viable in the long term,” it said.\n\nA spokesperson for GM told The Drive that unapproved aftermarket services “could affect critical safety features,” and pose other issues.\n\n“Aftermarket services that introduce features not originally designed, thoroughly tested, and approved by GM may cause unintended issues for customers,” the GM spokesperson said, in response to this matter. “These issues could affect critical safety features and may also void portions of the vehicle’s warranty.”\n\nIt is unclear if the aftermarket CarPlay system actually poses any safety issues, or if GM is simply unhappy that one dealership decided to go against the company’s decision to focus on its own software platform. It is also unclear if customers who already had the installation service completed will be affected in any way.', 'comment_score': 11, 'comment_created_utc': 1742572604.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgk54d'}, {'comment_id': 'mizyotr', 'comment_author': 'FreddyForshadowing', 'comment_body': ""Well, guess when I'm looking for a new car I can scratch GM off my list to even bother with.

But much like old dogs, these devices have a hard time learning new tricks.\n\n“They need a lot of demos to learn new tasks, and people with disabilities aren’t able to provide these demos,” says Professor Aman Behal, an assistive robotics expert at UCF. “If they can, they might not be the best demos for the robot to learn from.”\n\nBehal aims to address this challenge with his new research project, Mobile Robot Manipulators for Learning and Executing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. The project is supported through a three-year, $600,000 grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research.\n\nCurrently, mobile assistive robotics can be mounted to the side of a wheelchair or can trail behind the individual, ready to assist when needed. These devices allow users to navigate their homes or travel to places like an office or local park, offering greater flexibility than stationary fixed-base robotics.\n\nWhile the dexterity of these robots allows them to assist with complex tasks like brushing hair or cutting a piece of steak, they can be difficult for the user to control or teach. Assistive robots perform tasks better over time by mimicking the user, but in these situations, the user may not be able to complete the task correctly — or at all.\n\nBehal and his team of researchers, including Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy Morris Beato, and Professor of Statistics and Data Science Edgard Maboudou, will create intelligent and mobile robotic assistants that offer easier control and a better robot-human interface.\n\nThe project’s first year will focus on research and development, while the second and third years will incorporate testing and user feedback. Initial testing\xa0 will be conducted with students, followed by studies involving adults with upper body paralysis.\n\n“We will recruit adults between the ages of 18 and 65, bring them (into our lab) and essentially get the robots to do several tasks,” Behal says. “At the end of it, we’ll see how easy it was to interact with the robot.”\n\nThe researchers will survey the participants to find out how many times they had to tell the robot to perform a task, how long it took for the robot to complete the action, how many mistakes were made and how satisfied they were with the robot’s assistance.\n\nThe end goal is to develop smart robots that can give the user a greater degree of independence, leading to increased self-esteem and enhanced quality of life.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742569416.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgiwa7'}, {'comment_id': 'mizj353', 'comment_author': 'mriggs1234', 'comment_body': '""They need a lot of demos to learn new tasks, and people with disabilities aren’t able to provide these demos."" – This is a key point.

He's an idealist and I truly believe if you put him on a lie detector test, he would pass if you asked him if he wants to improve humanity.\n\nPeople hate to give him credit but he truly did move the needle in EV adoption and space technology. He's also a sociopath and narcissist. The thing that gave him audacity to start a space company and lead an EV car company also gave him the audacity to go head to head against NASA and the government in court and then WIN. He got early space contracts from NASA by suing because they were awarded to Boeing and some other incumbent companies that were bloated and slow and had no results to show for it. And SpaceX ran circles around them. He pissed off a lot of officials during a Democrat run govt and he's been on their shit list.\n\nThe Biden White House hosted an EV day, solar day, green energy day and they excluded Tesla and Elon. It was unfairly personal against Elon. He has a point there. Tesla was far and away the EV leader. Tesla owns 47% of market share for solar. He was being punished.\n\nAt the same time Elon started to reconcile with his father who was previously viciously rejected by Elon. This father is as big of a nutjob as there can ever be for right wing conspiracies. The thing is that Elon is really the same person as his father. Elon hated his father because he saw how awful he was and also he recognized the worst parts of himself in his father. Now he was starting to embrace that crazy.\n\nAnyways, a Twitter purchase and election later, Elon has taken over the government and is treating it like one of his companies. Instead of citizens, we're treated like employee. We're quantified, measured by our dollar value and treated accordingly. If you're not a net positive to the economy, you should be discarded. That's the path to profitable companies, but unhappy dystopian countries. \n\nSo I do think Musk is misguided. He's pretty evil.

It's pretty debatable that he could even get much from SpaceX because it is simply much more complex to liquidate ownership in a private company vs public share value.\n\nSo even if what you were saying here were true, the portion of his wealth that comes from Tesla is the portion that is most easily available for him to use as financial firepower. Leveraging the rest is *way* more difficult and requires him to do things that undermine his larger position and make him less powerful as a result (for instance, forcing him to diminish his ownership over SpaceX would be a big win, as would forcing him to try to get additional money via SpaceX by corrupt contacts, such as the one to oversee air traffic control).\n\n>How are you going to do that when SpaceX is the biggest next one and it's funded by secured government contacts\n\nI don't have a fully formed answer for that right now. But there are definitely ways that are available. For one, Starlink dishes are pretty easy to spot and mess with, and the cost of maintaining the Starlink constellation is pretty significant, so a loss of users pretty quickly results in a financial bleed. For two, many of the employees at SpaceX strongly dislike Musk, and that presents a number of opportunities to drive a wedge between him and that company.\n\n>You have to address things at the government level to make a difference.\n\nMusk currently owns the government, so no, that really isn't an option at the moment. Again, a prerequisite for elections is removing Musk's ability to simply buy them. And that has to be done outside of elections.\n\nAlso, direct action definitely makes a difference -- for instance, the collapse of Tesla's share price directly lead to the President doing a car commercial in front of the white house...and it caused at most a momentary pause in the price collapse. That both an act of desperation and also a serious loss of face -- Trump and Musk draw a lot of their power from the belief by other powerful people that they can rule effectively, and when they fail to impose their will on the world it weakens that perception and thereby weakens the willingness of other powerful people to go along with them.\n\nForcing powerful people to respond and then publicly fail *definitely* makes a difference. Loss of the perception of strength is a major threat to dictators, and this feeds into that.\n\nAlso, this action is taking the initiative and taking the battle to Musk...which forces him to call in favors and expend effort responding to and combatting it. One of the biggest problems with the Democrats right now is that they are purely reactive -- Trump and Musk act and they are left trying to figure out how to respond. And this has been true with some of the other protests as well. But these actions against Tesla are active and self-initiated, and that gives them a strength that simply waiting for an election and hoping you get a good choice will never have.\n\nSo I think you're misreading the situation, friend. I think attacking Elon Musk's wealth and power is a key to making progress against the fascist onslaught."", 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742545378.0, 'comment_level': 9, 'parent_id': 'mixe6xs', 'post_id': '1jffu71'}, {'comment_id': 'miywnwq', 'comment_author': 'hepatitisC', 'comment_body': ""You keep saying if what I'm saying is true.  Tesla is a publicly traded company.  They release records of their profits, stockholdings, etc.  It's all public record.  It's not my opinion, and it's not hard to verify. His portion is less than 13% of the company.  At 750 billion valuation, his portion would be worth at most $97.5B.  Starlink's current consumer revenue is $8.2B in 2024.  So again, even if you vandelized every Tesla on the road and every Starlink consumer dish, he would still be one of the richest people in the world.  I get the direction you're trying to go, but to me the logic and approach is just not going to be effective to the end goal of getting him to change his behavior.  \n\nThe better bet isn't putting pressure on him, because I just objectively demonstrated that he will not lose enough to matter.  People could instead put pressure via the stockholdings, pressure competing companies to step up and provide better alternatives, and pressure representatives as a key.

(“Rich” is in quotes because many middle-class skilled laborers without college degrees earn the SS maximum.)\nI did some actuarial calculations once and the poor person (receives 90%) “earns” about a 15% return on taxes (over a period where the S&P returned 12%) and the rich person “earns” about a 0% return (an interest free loan.

That’s doing something. That’s activism. \n\nStart here:\n\nhttps://www.boycottoligarchs.com\n\n>The power of oligarchs grows directly with financial disparity and wealth. One person with $100 billion can be more powerful than 100 people with $1 billion each.\n\n>Their wealth is primarily in the form of stocks. Even a 10-20% drop in revenue can cause their companies to go from hugely profitable to unprofitable, and it would crush their stock prices. Billionaires liquid assets come from taking loans against their stock holdings.\n\n>The goal must be to not just reduce the power of oligarchs, but to prevent the ability to become one. Within capitalism, decision making power and profits are given to those who own stocks, land, and property. In a capitalistic system, money begets more money and power. \n\n>Instead of giving your money to billionaires, start buying from smaller businesses first. When there’s not a more ethical alternative, consider trying to start a worker co-op with some like-minded people, or crowdfunding others who want to do the same. Take power out of their hands, and put it into the hands of normal people. Create a parallel economy.\n\nI’ve spent since inauguration restructuring my entire footprint and eliminating any of my money going into pockets of capitalists.

So a false premise. Or more precisely, an unstrategic premise. You\'re evaluating these people on their own individual merits instead of their role within our party and broader politics.\n\nSchumer\'s competitor will absolutely be a worse person and a worse senator than Schumer. But Schumer\'s position of leadership is an anchor that\'s dragging the Dem party down. He\'s an awful negotiator and has been an awful negotiator for decades. And he\'s our key negotiator and won\'t step down from that role. His primary go-to for negotiation is getting on his knees and servicing his opponent. If this were a normal job, he would\'ve been fired for gross ineptitude, but he\'s allowed to just stay in indefinitely making sure we lose on every front, including elections.\n\nAs for Jeffries, you seem to be confused. I was talking about his *primary* challengers there. I\'d still vote for him in a general if I had to. But he and his office don\'t return calls from constituents about key issues. And he\'s one of our main spokespeople, but he has the charisma of a used sponge left in dirty water overnight. He\'s a *liability* in that role.\n\nAgain, you\'re not looking at the wider role these people play beyond their seats. Their seats are absolutely important. But in Schumer\'s case, his wider impact is more important than his seat, and it\'s a straight negative as is.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742565129.0, 'comment_level': 10, 'parent_id': 'miz1goi', 'post_id': '1jg6pgn'}, {'comment_id': 'miz17hk', 'comment_author': 'StoneCypher', 'comment_body': '> If you do not understand the difference, then you are not following American politics very closely.\n\nI\'m extremely bored of people saying ""if you don\'t agree with me, you\'re not paying attention""\n\nWhen you actually look at the details of this specific situation, your tune will change\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Chuck Schumer is an active impediment to our party right now.\n\nI\'m aware of what he did.

George W. Bush assumed the presidency. In e-mail distributed on Capitol Hill earlier this month, Mrs. Thomas solicited resumes ''for transition purposes'' from the government oversight committees of Congress.*\n\n\n*A decision by Justice Thomas to recuse himself could alter the outcome of the case now before the court, which is weighing whether to allow a manual recount of votes in Florida. On Saturday, by a vote of 5 to 4, the court blocked the recount for now. Justice Thomas, who was appointed to the court by President George Bush, Governor Bush's father, was in the majority.*\n\n\n*If Justice Thomas were to recuse himself, it could result in a 4-to-4 tie in the case now before it, which would allow the ruling by the Florida Supreme Court to stand.*\n\n\n*''There is no conflict here,'' Mrs. Thomas said in an interview. She insisted that she rarely discussed matters before the Supreme Court with her husband and that Justice Thomas therefore should not consider recusing himself from the landmark case.*\n\n\n*A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore said he had no comment on accusations of a conflict of interest. ''The Vice President has the highest regard for the independent judiciary, so we're not going to comment on the various questions that have been raised,'' said Mark Fabiani, a Gore campaign spokesman.*\n\n\n*Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush transition team, said he was aware that the Heritage Foundation regularly collected job resumes during presidential transitions, but he said he did not know if the organization was coordinating its efforts with the Bush camp.*\n\n\n*Like many professional women, Mrs. Thomas should not be judged by her spouse,'' Mr. Fleischer said, denying any conflict of interest. ''She should be judged on her own merits and qualifications.''*\n\n\n*He suggested that the accusations were the work of the Gore campaign.*\n\n\n*A federal appellate judge, Gilbert S. Merritt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, said he saw a serious conflict of interest for Justice Thomas in deciding a case that could throw the election to Governor Bush.*\n\n\n*''The spouse has obviously got a substantial interest that could be affected by the outcome,'' he said in an interview from his home in Nashville. ''You should disqualify yourself. I think he'd be subject to some kind of investigation in the Senate.''*\n\n\n*Judge Merritt, who has long association with the Gore family and was considered a leading contender for the Supreme Court early in the Clinton Administration, said he would not launch a formal complaint against Justice Thomas.*\n\n\n*But he urged Justice Thomas to remove himself from the case in order to prevent any violation of a federal law -- he cited Section 455 of Title 28 of the United States Code, ''Disqualification of Justices, Judges or Magistrates'' -- that requires court officers to excuse themselves if a spouse has ''an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.''*\n\n\n*Judge Merritt offered his views about Justice Thomas after someone in the Gore campaign provided The New York Times with his name and telephone number. Judge Merritt said he had had no direct contact with the Gore campaign.*\n\n\n*Kathy Arberg, a spokesman for the Supreme Court, said she had no comment on the accusations of a conflict of interest. The Court has also been unwilling to comment on a suggestion from Gore campaign aides that Justice Antonin Scalia should consider recusing himself because his son works for a firm that represents Mr. Bush.*\n\n\n*The son, Eugene Scalia, is a partner in the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Another partner, Theodore B. Olson, argued Mr. Bush's case before the Supreme Court today.*\n\n\n**Referring to her husband, one of the court's most conservative and taciturn members, Mrs. Thomas said, ''We don't talk about Supreme Court business. Clarence just isn't the kind. He protects me. We have our separate professional lives.''**\n\n\n**On Dec. 4, Mrs. Thomas sent an e-mail message to members of the House and Senate committees on government oversight seeking resumes for the presidential transition. She directed would-be applicants to forward their resumes along with a history of political activities or references to an associate at the foundation.**\n\n\n**Mrs. Thomas said tonight that her recruitment efforts were bipartisan and not on behalf of the Bush campaign.**\n\n\n**''The Bush campaign would be as surprised as I was by any implication that I was working with them,'' she said.**\n\n\n*Mrs. Thomas acknowledged, however, that her search was likely to generate more interest among Republicans, because of the foundation's conservative orientation.*\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/12/us/contesting-vote-challenging-justice-job-thomas-s-wife-raises-conflict-interest.html?smid=url-share"", 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742566975.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'miyghp6', 'post_id': '1jgedy7'}, {'comment_id': 'mizklp9', 'comment_author': 'puterdood', 'comment_body': 'If Gore had won in 2000...

Kennedy.\n\nBoth The New York Times and the The Washington Post report that the personal information — including Social Security numbers of congressional staff members, intelligence researchers and others — was made public on Tuesday, March 18, along with their corresponding files on the 1963 assassination.\n\nFormer Trump campaign lawyer Joseph diGenova, whose information was apparently part of the release, told the Post that the move was “absolutely outrageous” as well as “sloppy” and “unprofessional.”\n\n“It not only means identity theft, but I’ve had threats against me,” said diGenova. “In the past, I’ve had to report real threats against me to the FBI. There are dangerous nuts out there.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, per the Times, that the Trump administration is aware that it released personal information of former government employees and that the National Archives and the Social Security Administration “immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals whose personal information was released in the files.”\n\nThe Department of Justice did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Thursday, March 20.\n\nThe release of the documents on March 18 — 64,000 of the 80,000 total pages Trump had promised — came just one day after the president vowed to release all the remaining assassination files during a Monday visit to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nA person with knowledge of the documents’ release told the Times that officials knew releasing them without redactions would lead to the publishing of Americans’ personal information. Journalists and historians sifting through the document drop have so far failed to uncover any major new revelations about the assassination itself.\n\nWilliam Harnage, a former government contractor, told the Times that he considered the release of his information “almost criminal.” Harnage said he learned from a reporter that his Social Security number from a 1977 file had been made public.\n\nAccording to the Post, among the information made public was the personal information of some former staffers of the Church Committee — a group that identified abuses by the CIA, FBI, Internal Revenue Service and multiple other agencies. Some of those people have since frozen their bank accounts and credit cards after being contacted by reporters this week.\n\n“It just shows the danger of how this administration is handling these things with no thought of who gets damaged in the process,” a former staffer of the Church Committee told the newspaper.\n\n“It seems like the damage is done, but clearly we have to talk to some lawyers,” the staffer added.\n\nJudy K. Barga, a former government contractor who still supports Trump overall, told the Times that the release of her personal information was “not good for anybody.”\n\n“People’s private information should be kept private,” she said.\n\nAs previously reported, the release of the files pertaining to the death of Kennedy — who was fatally shot during a Dallas motorcade in November 1963 — was teased during Trump’s first term, before former President Joe Biden took limited action by releasing some.\n\nTrump has also ordered the release of files pertaining to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nJack Schlossberg — the only grandson of JFK — has repeatedly slammed Trump for pushing to declassify the remaining assassination files, which historians and insiders have long warned were unlikely to reveal anything surprising or validate conspiracy theories, given that the most substantial files were already public.\n\n“The truth is [a lot] sadder than the myth — a tragedy that didn’t need to happen,” Schlossberg wrote in a Jan. 23 post to X, which he shared on Instagram later that day. “Not part of an inevitable grand scheme.”\n\nHe added, “Declassification is using JFK as a political prop, when he’s not here to punch back. There’s nothing heroic about it.”', 'comment_score': 203, 'comment_created_utc': 1742510433.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'miwnapj', 'comment_author': 'thisguypercents', 'comment_body': '>\xa0Trump administration is aware that it released personal information of former government employees and that the National Archives and the Social Security Administration “immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals whose personal information was released in the files.”\n\n\nThey get 1 year free credit monitoring.', 'comment_score': 51, 'comment_created_utc': 1742523086.0, 'comment_level': 2, 'parent_id': 'mivmoha', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'mix70nb', 'comment_author': 'vinegar', 'comment_body': 'Proactively, after the fact.', 'comment_score': 14, 'comment_created_utc': 1742530779.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'miwnapj', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'mizoly0', 'comment_author': 'badcookies', 'comment_body': 'Best they can do is a $20 gift card to trump towers', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742571799.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'miwnapj', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'mivz7yg', 'comment_author': 'JMurdock77', 'comment_body': '>”There are dangerous nuts out there”\n\nIncluding the now-director and deputy director of said agency…', 'comment_score': 76, 'comment_created_utc': 1742514447.0, 'comment_level': 2, 'parent_id': 'mivmoha', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'miww1yi', 'comment_author': 'Steadyandquick', 'comment_body': 'The calls are indeed coming from inside the House.', 'comment_score': 17, 'comment_created_utc': 1742526245.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'mivz7yg', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'mixjeno', 'comment_author': 'hatshepsut_ruled', 'comment_body': 'The dangerous nuts are inside the House.', 'comment_score': 3, 'comment_created_utc': 1742537230.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'mivz7yg', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'miwwvho', 'comment_author': 'TripleJeopardy3', 'comment_body': 'Just FYI, this is a violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 and individuals can sue the government for it.', 'comment_score': 32, 'comment_created_utc': 1742526556.0, 'comment_level': 2, 'parent_id': 'mivmoha', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'miwxrs4', 'comment_author': 'JDSchu', 'comment_body': 'Thank goodness the money for those lawsuits will come directly from the people responsible and not from taxpayers.\n\n\nWait, shoot.\xa0', 'comment_score': 20, 'comment_created_utc': 1742526901.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'miwwvho', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'mivvupd', 'comment_author': 'hungry4nuns', 'comment_body': '> Social Security numbers and other private information belonging to hundreds of Americans — some of whom are still living — were made public\n\nOh no\n\n…\n\n> National Archives and the Social Security Administration “immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals \n\nOk sounds promising\n\n…\n\nWait go back up a second …\n\n> some of whom are still living\n\nOh no', 'comment_score': 32, 'comment_created_utc': 1742513376.0, 'comment_level': 2, 'parent_id': 'mivmoha', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'miwa1c1', 'comment_author': 'Borne2Run', 'comment_body': ""Dude with a SSN working for US govt in 1980 would've been in their 20s and easily have died from any numbers of causes by 2025."", 'comment_score': -13, 'comment_created_utc': 1742518230.0, 'comment_level': 3, 'parent_id': 'mivvupd', 'post_id': '1jg1ttm'}, {'comment_id': 'mix2ecc', 'comment_author': 'jsdeprey', 'comment_body': 'What? why do you say that?

According to Bloomberg, several countries – including France and Italy – refused to commit to specific financial contributions.\n\nFrance and Italy believe the initiative is still insufficiently developed and are requesting more technical and financial details.\n\nFrench diplomats stated that while they support the goals of the initiative, their priority is the EU’s €18 billion contribution to the G7 loan package for Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, France and Italy – the EU’s two largest economies after Germany – are reluctant to publicly disclose how much they are willing to provide, especially when large sums are involved.\n\nEarlier this year, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, proposed that EU countries provide up to €40 billion in military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The aid would be voluntary – either in cash or equipment. However, after several countries raised objections, this week’s discussions were narrowed to focus solely on the ammunition component.\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo advocated for the initiative and complained about the resistance it faced from some EU capitals. Many countries are not “performing adequately” when it comes to arms deliveries to Ukraine, he said.\n\nAt the same time, others criticized the approach of setting contribution figures too early, before securing the countries’ agreement to participate.\n\nLithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said setting numbers first “was done backwards.”\n\n“It may create an impression that someone doesn’t do enough – but readiness to support Ukraine is there, even if it is difficult to quantify it now,” Nausėda told reporters.\n\nLinked by video to the summit in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on EU leaders to urgently provide €5 billion for artillery shells for Ukraine. Kaja Kallas had previously put forward a similar initiative.\n\nZelensky made an urgent plea for the sum to purchase ammunition “as soon as possible,” making reference to a massive overnight drone strike over Ukraine as the war drags on.\n\n“It’s crucial that your support for Ukraine doesn’t decrease but instead continues and grows,” Zelensky said. “And this is especially true for air defense, military aid, and our overall resilience.”', 'comment_score': 29, 'comment_created_utc': 1742558043.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jg8a5a'}, {'comment_id': 'miyn2xy', 'comment_author': 'Well-Sourced', 'comment_body': '[Russia reports massive drone attack on airfield in Volgograd Oblast | New Voice of Ukraine](https://english.nv.ua/nation/explosions-reported-near-russian-airfield-in-volgograd-amid-alleged-drone-attack-50499760.html)\n\n\n\nAt least seven explosions were reported in the village of Oktyabrsky in Russia’s Volgograd Oblast, with reports claiming the Marinovka airfield was under attack.\n\nAccording to the Telegram channel Shot, witnesses said the loud blasts caused windows to shake in their frames.\n\nShortly afterward, Volgograd regional governor Andrei Bocharov claimed that a “massive UAV attack” on the Kalachevsky district had allegedly been “repelled” by Russian air defenses, with no reported casualties.\n\nA day earlier, drones operated by Ukraine’s SBU Security Service and Special Operations Forces (SSO) attacked the Engels airfield in Russia’s Saratov Oblast.

Hitting Heathrow at that vulnerable point will force the British to fix the problem and make the system more robust, which will almost certainly make that target harder to hit in the future. I’d save that for a more critical moment, one where taking out Heathrow would cause the maximum impact, such as the start of or during a conventional war when airliners with troops will likely use Heathrow to get to the front lines more quickly.

He has also announced an unprecedented inspection and digitisation of the vaccination records of all children in Poland.\n\n>The developments come after an unvaccinated child was admitted to hospital in Wrocław this month with diptheria, a disease that it is obligatory in Poland to vaccinate against. Recent years have, however, seen a\xa0rapid growth in the number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children.\n\n>This is “the first case of severe diphtheria in an unvaccinated child in many years in Poland”, said Grzesiowski at a press conference on Tuesday. He noted that the six-year-old child had developed the illness after returning from Africa.\n\n>Diphtheria can often be fatal in young children. The infected child in Wrocław remains in serious condition, with Grzesiowski revealing that he has been placed into an induced coma. An adult who had close contact with the child has also been hospitalised with a milder case of the disease.\n\n>\n\n>In an\xa0interview\xa0with broadcaster TVN on Thursday, Grzesiowski argued that action needs to be taken to ensure that parents comply with the requirement to give their children mandatory vaccinations.\n\n>He noted that currently, although parents can in theory be fined for failing to do so, the legal process can “last several years and it does not work”. Parents are able to “not vaccinate their child and not have any major problems because of it”.\n\n>To improve the situation, “we would have to change the entire system, rebuilding it in such a way that an unvaccinated child would have to have difficult access to various elements of social life, such as preschool or school or any other where a large group could be infected”, said Grzesiowski.\n\n>\n\n>But he admitted that this would be difficult “because in the Polish legal system everyone has the right to use preschool or school – this is guaranteed by the constitution – so there are no simple solutions here”.\n\n>Article 70 of Poland’s constitution states that: “Everyone shall have the right to education. Education to 18 years of age shall be compulsory.” Some lawmakers have previously\xa0proposed banning unvaccinated children\xa0from nurseries and preschools, a measure already implemented by a handful of local authorities.\n\n>Speaking to TVN, Grzesiowski said that any such measures would not be about depriving children of education but of deciding how that education takes place. “Can a child take part in group glasses or will they have to have an individual course of care or education,” he said.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742573124.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jggezl'}, {'comment_id': 'miztova', 'comment_author': 'BubsyFanboy', 'comment_body': '>However, Grzesiowski emphasised that above all it is crucial that parents receive reliable information in order to disabuse them of the idea that vaccines harm, rather than help, children.\n\n>Poland, like other countries, has seen a rapid rise in the number of parents refusing compulsory vaccinations for their children. The number of such cases rose from 3,437 in 2010 to 87,344 – a more than 25-fold increase.\n\n>As a result, the number of children being vaccinated against some diseases, such as measles, has\xa0fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity. In 2017, the level had dropped to 93% and is now even lower. Last year, Poland saw a\xa0surge in measles infections.\n\n>\n\n>In a separate interview on Thursday with broadcaster Radio Zet, Grzesiowski also revealed that his organisation, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate (GIS), will in the coming weeks launch its first-ever inspection of the vaccination records of all children in Poland.\n\n>Inspectors will manually check around 7.5 million records. “This system is still based on paper documents, so the inspector must go to the vaccination point and check by looking at each vaccination card,” explained Grzesiowski.\n\n>As part of the inspection, the data will be transferred to an electronic system, making it easier in the future to check who has been vaccinated and against which diseases.\n\n>Those plans drew criticism from the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) party, which has long\xa0opposed many forms of compulsory vaccination.

The fighting could seem too small scale and too local and thus could be considered a local problem and not one for the entire alliance.

There isn’t really a requirement that the Department must exist in any really specific form, just a number of programs that were administered by that agency.  And his EO specifically takes the approach of basically scooping out everything that the law requires, and leaving the Department a nearly completely hollowed-out shell.\n\nThis is something the right-wingers have been *praying* for - *LITERALLY* - for generations.  They won’t fuck it up by sending him an EO that could be defeated in court.  And while I’m not a constitutional lawyer, my reading of it is that it’s all very legal.\n\nWhich fucking sucks, I mean if you ask me the *primary* cause of most of our current problems is that we have undervalued, underfunded, and failed to set (much less achieve) the educational goals necessary to have the kind of populace - an informed one - which wouldn’t, ya know, elect a tyrant and then cheer as he destroys *everything*.  Now we’re going to rapidly see a departure from the profession of the most talented and most necessary people, alongside the death of a federalized, public school system.  We can still *kind of* expect that a person with a diploma from an Alabama high school knows as much as someone with a diploma from a Connecticut school.\n\nI’m pretty sure that’s going to be proven to be *wildly* untrue in the span of five years or less.

That Black people are “naturally shiftless & brutish.”  That Hitler had some points, if you think about it.\n\nIt’s going to get *dark*, and at least in this case, there is very little that can be done to stop it.  There will be legal fillings but at most, they’ll be delaying tactics.  My hope is that they delay *enough* to get us to the midterms, the midterms actually happen, the process and results are fair & not tampered with, the Democrats win on a platform of saving public education, and win enough of a mandate that they’re able to pass legislation which saves (and even improves!) it.\n\nBut I don’t have a great deal of hope for that.

It\'s the great American Recreation Activity, finding something to be pissed off about.\n\nThen you look at the media they consume and you see why. All the people that win every day they see got pissed off at something, mad enough to get and use a gun, and get what they want and need. They are led to believe that might makes right. The same people that in the majority think they can take on a lion hand to hand if they really needed to. But don\'t dare put on them a sense of responsibility. You say anything that makes them think THEY personally have to do something they will turn against you in a second. They want someone to go out there and make people as miserable as they are, and they think they have it so bad.\n\nI heard benefactors of a public community pool in my town talking about how bad they had it. They were basking in the sun at a public pool with dozens of kids running around having a great time. They literally said that they had it as bad as the Jews in Poland and Germany.

Trump said he would do bad to the bad people, and admitted good people would be caught up on it. That is good to them. Trump said he would do the dirty work and that is what they want. Democrats said ""we"" will make things better. That is enough presumptuousness to them that they will vote against them. It\'s presumptuous that people want to be part of activism. Trump\'s people only want to vote, and barely that.\n\nIt\'s bad here. The people swear we are on the brink of catastrophe but it is only because we keep pinching closer to the edge.

They will vote for fascists because they believe that they will personally benefit and they don\'t care about who gets hurt.

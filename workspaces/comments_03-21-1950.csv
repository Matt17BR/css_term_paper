Using data from a global lightning detection network, my colleagues and I have been studying how exhaust plumes from ships are associated with an increase in the frequency of lightning.

For decades, ship emissions steadily rose as increasing global trade drove higher ship traffic. Then, in 2020, new international regulations cut ships’ sulfur emissions by 77%. Our newly published research shows how lightning over shipping lanes dropped by half almost overnight after the regulations went into effect.

https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00009-1

Summary

Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability, affecting more women than men. Different immune cells contribute to this sexual divergence, but the mechanisms, especially in females, are not well defined. We show that pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels on microglia and T cells differentially cause mechanical allodynia, a debilitating symptom of neuropathic pain. In male rodents, Panx1 drives vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) release from microglia. Cell-specific knockdown of microglial Panx1 or pharmacological blockade of the VEGF receptor attenuated allodynia in nerve-injured males. In females, nerve injury increased spinal CD8+ T cells and leptin levels. Leptin release from female-derived CD8+ T cells was Panx1 dependent, and intrathecal leptin-neutralizing antibody injection sex-specifically reversed allodynia. Adoptive transfer of female-derived CD8+ T cells caused robust allodynia, which was prevented by a leptin-neutralizing antibody or leptin small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. Panx1-targeted approaches may alleviate neuropathic pain in both sexes, while T cell- and leptin-directed treatments could have sex-dependent benefits for women.

From the linked article:

Why pain medication may not be as effective for women as it is for men

UCalgary researchers reveal biological differences between the sexes when it comes to chronic pain

A new study led by University of Calgary professor Dr. Tuan Trang, PhD, may help to explain why there is an over-representation of women experiencing chronic pain compared to men. In 2019, the Canadian Pain Task Force report found chronic pain is more common among females of all ages, including children, when compared to males.

“Both males and females develop pain, but each sex develops it through different means,” says Trang, a professor in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and Cumming School of Medicine (CSM). “This study identifies a very unique type of biological process through a specific immune cell that is distinctive to each sex.”

The study, published in Neuron, focused on neuropathic pain, which is caused by injury to a nerve or the nervous system. A debilitating symptom of this is allodynia which is experienced when someone feels pain from a stimulus that does not typically cause pain. This condition can be very hard to treat; for instance, things like a light touch, temperature changes, and clothing against the skin can be agonizing. The study, conducted in rats and mice, found that in both sexes pain signals can be communicated by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels but through different types of immune cells.

For decades dogs have been employed to provide support to individuals with specific needs, offering them physical assistance, emotional support and even alerting them to medical emergencies.

miyurjn,Potential_Being_7226,"From the press release:

To begin with, the researchers examined high-resolution tree canopy data to determine the structure of tree-covered green spaces within a radius of 500 metres of a person’s place of residence. In addition to recording the total area covered by all tree clusters, they also identified the proximity and connectedness of tree clusters, their geometrical complexity and the fragmentation level.

They linked this information with the survival time of the resident in the respective neighbourhood for over six million adults, i.e. looking exclusively at natural-cause deaths due to illness and old age. This data, supplied by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, covers over a ten-year period (2010–2019). In order to protect privacy, the Federal Statistical Office rounded the coordinates of citizens’ residences to the nearest 50 metres.

**Tree quantity and positioning both matter**

Data analysis shows that both the tree canopy cover in residential areas and their spatial arrangement correlate with mortality. The study identified a significantly lower mortality risk in people who live in neighbourhoods with large, contiguous and well networked areas of tree canopies than for people who live in areas with fewer, fragmented areas of tree canopies with complex geometries. This correlation is particularly evident in densely developed peri-urban and urban areas with poor air quality and high temperatures: if such areas feature well-structured forested green spaces, the residents may receive more health benefits than other areas.

Yet, while this study represents an important first step, it is still not possible to draw conclusions regarding the causes. The researchers are not yet able to state with precision the pathways through which tree canopy configuration influences human health. Nevertheless, the study’s findings at the individual level are generally consistent with the results of similar studies at the community level in Philadelphia, Tehran and Taipei.

When people talk about “thinking” or “brain activity,” they’re usually referring to grey matter. It’s mostly located on the outer surface of the brain (the cortex).


White matter, on the other hand, consists of nerve fibers (axons) covered in a fatty substance called myelin, which gives it a white appearance. 

White matter acts like a communication network, connecting different parts of the brain and spinal cord, allowing them to send messages to each other quickly. It’s like the brain’s “wiring.”

mix94ej,Spaghett8,"You can think of gray matter like processing power, and white matter as processing speed. 

Both higher gray and white matter counts contribute to greater intelligence. Gray matter seems to have a higher correlation with complex thought. However, white matter is closely associated with memory and learning/making connections. 

Instead of an overall count of gray matter though. It generally seems that density in certain areas matter more. IE, Einstein’s brain was not large for his height and age. 

However, he did have dense concentrations of neurons and had many folds on his cortex (mainly gray matter), meaning that he had more surface area to make connections. 

Einstein also had a very wide corpus callosum (mainly white matter) which would have allowed his brains to transmit signals more than average. 

So, instead of dark matter / white matter counts. Intelligence is closer correlated with higher dark and white matter concentrations in integral parts of the brain. 

In short, it’s less about the amount of dark and white matter but about the concentration. Einstein didn’t have a particularly large brain, but he did have an extremely connected one.",169,1742531741.0,7,miwzrj6,1jfu8nz

From the linked article: 

Sex differences in brain structure are present at birth and remain stable during early development

New research published in Biology of Sex Differences has found that sex differences in brain structure are already present at birth and remain relatively stable during early postnatal development. The study found that while male infants tend to have larger total brain volumes, female infants, when adjusted for brain size, have more grey matter, whereas male infants have more white matter. These findings suggest that prenatal biological factors play a significant role in shaping early sex differences in brain structure.

The findings confirmed that male infants had larger total brain volumes compared to female infants, a pattern that has been consistently reported in older children and adults. However, when researchers adjusted for overall brain size, they found that female infants had significantly more grey matter, while male infants had more white matter.

Further analysis of specific brain regions showed that, even after accounting for differences in total brain volume, certain areas were larger in female infants, while others were larger in male infants. Female infants had relatively greater volumes in regions such as the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres of the brain, and the parahippocampal gyrus, an area involved in memory processing. Male infants had larger volumes in regions such as the medial and inferior temporal gyri, which are associated with visual and auditory processing.",856,1742491492.0,1,,1jfu8nz

miyfrej,chrisdh79,"From the article: It’s been known for some time that some — but not all — female white-necked jacobin hummingbirds take on the brightly colored plumage worn by males. In a study [published](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347225000314?dgcid=coauthor) February 19 in Animal Behaviour, a team of researchers from the UW and Carnegie Mellon University have discovered the reason: They’re mimicking males. That trickery results in reduced aggression from other hummingbirds and increased access to nectar resources. 

“This research takes a mental model we’ve been describing for a while in our papers and gives it a mathematical backbone,” said Jay Falk, an evolutionary biologist who led this research while working as a postdoctoral scholar in the UW biology department. “It can be easy to think of natural selection as a force that is constantly choosing one single optimum. But this model adds to our understanding of how diversity, especially diversity within sexes, can be a stable endgame.” 

Relying on the principles of game theory and incorporating previously collected behavioral data, the researchers developed a model of hummingbird behavior to better understand how some birds choose their colors. The findings showed that “hybrid signals” — an equilibrium that can occur when signalers in a given situation may be dishonest — likely exist in nature.  

“In these hummingbirds, females want to mimic males,” said Kevin Zollman, a co-author of the study and director of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Complex Social Dynamics. “If they all did that, then they would end up being disbelieved. So, they end up settling into an equilibrium where some of them ‘lie,’ and they are sometimes ‘believed.’”",4,1742556466.0,1,,1jgel11

There article mentions that these bacteria made antibiotics were produced by certain strains of bacteria to overcompete other strains of the same bacteria species. To a point where more targeted treatments could potentially be more effective (in particular bacteriophage).


To expand on some of the discussion of the comments, antibiotics are fairly blunt as they kill broad range of bacteria (good and bad) and do have some significant drawbacks but overall are an invaluable tool to fight infections.
Phages (aka bacteriophage) are viruses that kils bacteria. Those have a much narrower target range and only kill one or few types of bacteria.
There is a lot of research going on to use phage for medical treatment of certain infections. There potentially a lot of benefits over antibiotics but there are still many limitations (especially in the delivery of the phages in a way to reach the infection).

What they found is that higher levels of cortisol were correlated with increased aggression. Along with, structural changes to the brain. They referenced the psychiatric disorders following the Dutch Famine. Which showed much higher rates of schizophrenia, depression, and other psychiatric and mood disorders among people who were in utero during the famine. 

It will be interesting to see what the rates of those disorders are in people who were in utero during covid. I wonder if there will be a difference among stress and malnutrition vs. just stress.

Lots of researchers have had this same concern regarding prenatal exposure to covid:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7759331/

It’s probably still too early to say what the full impact will be, but there are studies showing that prenatal exposure to viruses or the associated material inflammation increase the risk of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders:


>Both epidemiologic and birth cohort studies have demonstrated an association between infections and a corresponding increased incidence of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In particular, it has been demonstrated that in utero exposure to a variety of pathogens is likely a replicated risk factor for the neurodevelopmental insults that contribute to the later-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders, among several other neuropsychiatric conditions.

>Given the emerging association between prenatal infection and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, it is important that this risk is considered in the context of the unfolding pandemic. Here we review the existing literature on the link between epidemics, pandemics and the increased incidence of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In line with the body of evidence reviewed, it is plausible that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in utero may put children born during this pandemic at risk for specific neuropsychiatric outcomes, including schizophrenia.",4,1742564868.0,2,miyz4zh,1jgg0hx
miyrdw8,Potential_Being_7226,"From the press release:

Epigenetic modifications are chemical changes in DNA and its associated proteins that regulate gene activity without altering their sequence. One of the most studied modifications is DNA methylation, a process in which methyl groups—small molecules composed of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms—are added to specific regions of the DNA. This mechanism, essential for development, environmental adaptation, and disease predisposition, is influenced by genetics and responds to factors such as diet, stress, and exposure to pollutants.

The study results indicate that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression disorder are the neuropsychiatric disorders most strongly linked to DNA methylation in the placenta. Other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism, show some potentially causal associations, although to a lesser extent, while no visible effects were found in other analyzed pathologies. “These findings reinforce the hypothesis that schizophrenia and other disorders have a neurodevelopmental origin and that the placenta plays a fundamental role in this process,” explains Dr. Fernandez-Jimenez.

""Residential solar photovoltaics (PV) are important for a rapid decarbonization strategy. To chart an equitable energy transition, researchers have measured inequalities in residential PV adoption and identified factors that drive group disparities. We know little, however, about people’s experiences after installing solar. Electricity generation differences among PV systems can be substantial and may contribute to inequitable outcomes even as adoption disparities wane. Here we use data measuring actual monthly generation for over 26,000 PV systems installed in Connecticut to identify significant disparities in system output by neighbourhood income and race. We show that the choice of financing model (purchase or leasing) partly explains the observed disparities. We also find that system generation varies significantly across installers, highlighting that firm behaviour contributes to inequitable outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of measuring the quality and the quantity of renewable energy projects to ensure an equitable energy transition.""",5,1742567032.0,1,,1jgi03j

The whole thing doesn’t make a lot of sense, and sets up impossible expectations that most parents really struggle to meet. 

Of course it is a huge advantage to be wealthy and to be able to afford maids and a nanny etc. And being able to have only one parent working also allows the children to have much more parent time, but this is not feasible for most families.

I will often as the parents something like “how is their baby feeding?” “or how is the baby’s poops?” and they will answer “well the daycare hasn’t said there are any problems.” Like they don’t know their kid as well as the daycare. 

And many people’s extended families are not around to help. 

I strongly believe children should be raised by larger groups, of extended family, trusted and loved friends. Yes, by a community, a village. It’s a mistake that we have moved away from this. And I do believe children’s development is often affected by this too. 

Yes governmental intervention can help in certain ways, such as more parental leave after birth of babies. But I also think it’s a deep culture issue. We need to come together as extended families, friend groups, and communities. We have to stop fearing each other and forge community again.

For sure, but

1) Our system is designed so that a lot more labor is performed than there is a social need for being performed, which is why everyone's working all the time.

2) Our system is set up in a way that undermines active and engaged relationships outside the nuclear family (whether with extended family or, say, neighbors), which means things like childcare becomes either highly institutionalized (like understaffed, impersonal daycare centers) or highly inefficient (by a family always having sole caretaking duty of their child and noone but their child).

In a less bizarrely structured economic system, there'd be less need for people to work so much they get isolated, and so 1) people would have more time to take care of their own kids and 2) people would have the position to build up the connections needed to help look after their cousin's or neighbors kid as well as their own.

It is somewhat paradoxical, but I think in America lower income communities often have more of a culture of being there for each other and helping each other out. They often have more extended family nearby to help out. And they have closer bonds to extended family and their local communities.

Also often times the low income they would get from a low paying job would not really offset daycare costs much, so many low income families choose to have one parent stay home with the kids. And lower income families have access to benefits such as WIC, SNAP (food stamps), and Medicaid that make raising a child more feasible. Most families with two working parents do not have access to these government benefits.

And lower income families may not have the opportunity cost of hurting their career by focusing on raising kids. So they may not delay having kids for as long etc to focus on work. 

I think there are lots of other complex factors at play, these are just some of the reasons why people with lower income tend to have more kids. Access to contraception, family planning is another issue. 

Also, there is some data that the birth rate actually goes up for the ultra wealthy. For a family making 200,000 income per year, yes they are well off, but they have to work a lot to maintain that standard of living, and having more children makes it more and more difficult to do so.

You could be right! Because we're on the science sub, it feels important to mention that neither of us have any evidence. We're just pulling ideas out of our asses 

Are people more entwined with communities more likely to have kids because they're happier/feel safer, or are they more likely to have kids because their community will punish them by withholding respect or support if they don't?

I hope you realize that you're illustrating their point perfectly.

There are several rational reasons to question the value of studying that question (for example, what are the useful outcomes if such a study found a difference?), but instead you've leapt to accusations of racism and bad science.

It is indeed possible to study this question with good science and no racism; assuming otherwise is exactly the blind belief they note.  

(For context, I don't think this question should get funding because I think there are much more useful questions which should get that funding instead.  Regardless of whether there are or are not systematic cognitive differences between groups, the intra-group variability is almost certainly much larger than the inter-group variability, so the basic principle of *""treat individuals as individuals and not stand-ins for their group""* will be unchanged regardless of the findings.)",-9,1742492931.0,5,mitknyf,1jfnim1

You may be interested to note that you appear to be agreeing with me (that this research is not worth doing).

Based on your responses, it appears you also agree with the original poster that ""this topic is forbidden, essentially blasphemous"".

That is the attitude the original poster was pointing out -- not that such differences exist (probably not) or that they're worth studying (probably not), but that even *mentioning* them provokes accusations and vitriol from folks on the left, significantly undermining the prior comment's claim that left wing is science and right wing is conspiracies.

Don't get me wrong, the US right wing is worse right now (alarmingly so), but sadly there's no shortage of knee-jerk, ideology-based reasoning on the US left wing at the moment either.

Pretending our side has no flaws doesn't make those flaws disappear, it just makes them (a) harder to fix, and (b) more glaring to voters who are not already highly ideologically aligned.  As someone who would *very much* like Democrats to start winning elections, fixing some of these flaws that are standing in the way of winning over centrist voters is of significant interest to me.",-1,1742529780.0,7,miua253,1jfnim1

Which is completely what I expect would be found, and one of the reasons why I think other research would be more useful to fund.

However, the knee-jerk reaction that studying racial difference is necessarily (a) racist, and (b) trash science just due to *what* it is studying and not *how* it is studying it is the unfounded belief the other poster was pointing out.

As a point of objective fact, some research into racial differences is valuable; for example, [sickle cell disease shows large differences by race](https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-disease), and knowing that difference has important clinical implications.

Similarly, I would hope we can generally agree that what makes ""trash science"" is *badly conducted science*.  Is it not the case that there can be trash science on, say, ivermectin for use against a virus?  Or on vaccines and autism?

The results shore up the idea that memories can in fact be made during the earliest years of our lives, though what happens to these memories as the days, weeks and years roll by remains mysterious.

This wasn't healthy, but it did actually 'beat' childhood amnesia because I ended up reinforcing a bunch of very early memories. I have one from when I was about nine months old that my mom is certain is real. (No adult would have reinforced it, and it involves a furniture configuration at my grandma's place that wasn't photoghed & changed before I turned two so there's no way I could just spontaneously go 'that crib used to be under the red hook, and faced in this direction,' unless I remembered it.)

Also there's a couple of things I remember from before my brother was born (so I would have been under 2.5 years old) that I know are real & not adult reenforced because when I brought them up as an adult, my dad turned white and blurted out 'You weren't supposed to remember that!'

Once it’s out there, there won’t be a study of every case AI tries to diagnose, so we start to lose the ability to know if it’s actually detecting what we think it should. For example, AI interpreting images formatted in the way one specific academic institution formats them being different than the multitude of community hospitals and deciding that whatever formatting the university uses means cancer, simply because a higher proportion of cancer patients end up in the university hospital. 

I’m not saying it’s impossible that AI is unequivocally better, but outside the controlled environment of training images/studies there are so many extra variables for which the AI has never accounted. Every hospital seems like it has its own formatting system, way of scanning images, and way of documenting about images to the point that there are numerous points of failure since we just don’t know what the AI is using to decide cancer/not cancer.",1,1742521990.0,7,miwhor7,1jflda6

It’s not like hospitals have wildly different imaging systems producing entirely different images. The AI isn’t going to be attempting to diagnose cancer in a picture of a hummingbird.

You would be surprised how different images from different institutions look. If we have a universal standard formatting, I might be more inclined to agree with you. I’m only cautioning that we be sure that AI is actually detecting cancer. There are numerous examples of AI using a surrogate marker as a shortcut to diagnosis, such as diagnosing pneumonia on X-ray by using the fact that the X-ray was taken with a portable machine and the patient information lists that they are in the ICU rather than presence of actual pneumonia (which is an actual instance of AI shortcuts). I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that AI will get more sophisticated with time, but that also implies that the shortcuts will get more sophisticated as well.",3,1742523687.0,9,miwl706,1jflda6

My point is to not throw out the baby with the bathwater. AI will have false-positives just like humans have false-positives. AI will have car crashes that kill children just like humans have car crashes that kill children. In our world, the former is a national headline while the latter happens a hundred times and is just a blip in the local news.

What I am advocating strongly for is to understand the percentages and focus on ""is it better"", not ""is it perfect"". Unfortunately humans are really bad at interpreting statistical data and really good at finding one example to validate their worldview and then never wavering from that worldview.

But as any academic with students using these things for their assignments, or programmer, knows, relying on AI to get things *right* is fraught, because the AI isn't actually trying to tell the truth.

mizrzcm,WarningRepulsive4903,"Here's the abstract: 

**Introduction:** Citalopram and escitalopram are among the most used medications and are key treatments for many psychiatric disorders. Previous findings suggest citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates are changing because of the patent for citalopram ending as opposed to evidence of a clear therapeutic advantage-so-called ""evergreening"". This retrospective study focuses on characterizing the chronologic and geographic variation in the use of citalopram and escitalopram from 2015 to 2020 among US Medicaid and Medicare patients. We hypothesized that prescription rates of citalopram will decrease with a concurrent increase in escitalopram, consistent with ""evergreening"".

**Methods:** Citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates and costs per state were obtained from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database and Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data. States' annual prescription rates outside a 95% confidence interval were considered significantly different from the average.

**Results:** Overall, a decreasing trend for citalopram and an increasing trend for escitalopram prescription rates were noted in both Medicare and Medicaid patients. The differences between generic and brand were noted for both drugs, with generic forms being less expensive than the brand-name version.

**Discussion:** Despite limited evidence suggesting that citalopram and escitalopram have any meaningful differences in therapeutic or adverse effects, there exists a noticeable decline in the use of citalopram that cooccurred with an increase in escitalopram prescribing, consistent with our hypothesis. Moreover, among these general pharmacoepidemiologic trends exists significant geographic variability. There was disproportionate spending (relative to their use) on the brand versions of these medicines relative to their generic forms.

**Disclosure #1**: This study received no external funding.

**Disclosure #2**: I'm a co-author.",3,1742572770.0,1,,1jgk5dn

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(25)00059-8/fulltext

From the linked article: 

Gender gap in teenage depression is twice as large in London than in Tokyo, new study finds

Research led by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College London has tracked depressive symptoms in 7100 young people from Tokyo and London and shown girls have more depressive symptoms than boys in both cities. The study found that this gap is around twice as large in London and the year-on-year rise in depressive symptoms is around four times steeper for teenage girls in London than for teenage girls in Tokyo.

In both groups there was a difference between teenage boys and girls in the average level of depressive symptoms and this difference widened year-on-year. In the London sample the gender difference started slightly earlier (evident by 11-12 years) than in the Tokyo sample where it emerged between 11 and 14 years, and the average rate of change in depressive symptoms per year in London girls was around four times greater than among girls in Tokyo.

By the age of 16 the difference in depressive symptoms between boys and girls in London was around twice as large as in Tokyo. The average level of depressive symptoms in teenage boys in Tokyo declined between ages of 11 and 16, whereas for boys in London it increased slightly over time, following a similar trajectory to that of teenage girls in Tokyo.",1,1742583054.0,1,,1jgobd3

I can safely say the issue in this thread is one of oversimplification. To begin, the article is not about widespread public perceptions or presumptions, ostensibly held by many laypeople, about reading behaviors. Rather, the research is concerned with the specific phenomenon of ‘task adaptation,’ studied most often in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and education, and how participants in reading trials gain both momentum AND accuracy through repetition of reading tasks, a conclusion which supports one of the two commonly proposed ‘paradigms’ of task adaptation: learning-based adaptation.

Rather than gaining speed and consequently losing accuracy due to some tortured desire to end a trial quicker, which would support the other paradigm (motivation-based adaptation), the research here shows that readers gained speed and accuracy over time as their minds adapted to the task at hand, i.e. reading and recalling specific language within what they’re reading. 

As you can tell, OP’s title suffers from an impulse to oversimplify the subject matter, perhaps because it would be difficult to create a super snappy shorthand for what’s happening in the abstract.

e: Anyone reading this, please correct me if I’m wrong or being redundant – I woke up from a dead sleep, opened Reddit, and this is the first thing I looked at. Despite crust obscuring my vision, I decided this was a task of utmost importance.

Surely people will start out slow, trying to work out what's going on, and eventually, at varying paces, ""give up"" and just get it over with? So both modalities are most assuredly possible, and indeed, one would assume simultaneously occur to *some* degree in most ""natural"" cases.

Seems to me like the main finding of this paper is ""this reading task we have devised is something people can quickly improve at once they get a feel for the type of patterns that might come up"".

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/abstract](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/abstract)

Anti-amyloid drug shows signs of preventing Alzheimer’s dementia

An experimental drug appears to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s-related dementia in people destined to develop the disease in their 30s, 40s or 50s, according to the results of a study led by the Knight Family Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network-Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), which is based at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The findings suggest – for the first time in a clinical trial – that early treatment to remove amyloid plaques from the brain many years before symptoms arise can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s dementia.

The study is published March 19 in The Lancet Neurology.

The international study involved 73 people with rare, inherited genetic mutations that cause the overproduction of amyloid in the brain, all but guaranteeing that they will develop Alzheimer’s disease in middle age. For a subgroup of 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study’s start and who received the drug the longest – an average of eight years – the treatment lowered the risk of developing symptoms from essentially 100% to about 50%, according to a primary analysis of the data and supported by multiple sensitivity analyses supporting the trend. 

The findings provide new evidence to support the so-called amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease, which posits that the first step on the road to dementia is the build-up of amyloid plaques in the brain, and that removing such plaques or blocking their formation can stop symptoms from arising. For this study, Bateman and colleagues evaluated the effects of an experimental anti-amyloid drug to see if the medication could prevent the development of dementia.",188,1742435634.0,1,,1jfe1zz

Depending on the potential adverse outcomes, it also may not be ethical to test in a population that isn’t already definitively at high risk. Also, most dementia that gets diagnosed as Alzheimer’s is caused by mixed pathologies (AD plus cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, etc).

However, high levels of tau, the second hallmark of AD, are much more strongly correlated with cognitive impairment. The idea of addressing amyloid first is that you could stop this cascade of Amyloid->tau->neurodegeneration. However AD is extremely complex and there are also vascular and immunological components.

Nope, as yet we don't have enough evidence to say that.

Obviously it's intrinsically tied up with whatever mechanism is at play, but it's not as simple as ""plaques cause damage"".

Dementia is an umbrella term that describes a clinical syndrome characterized by cognitive dysfunction and loss of functional independence. AD can cause dementia but not always. There is no debate that amyloid aggregation is part of biological AD. Amyloid does not have to be the direct cause of impairment to be an important part of the disease process and is in fact believed to be the first major (easily measurable) change in the neuropathological cascade that leads to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. However, once someone has symptomatic AD, they are towards the end of the disease process and no pharmaceutical can reverse brain damage. That’s why the effort is on clearing amyloid before someone is experiencing significant impairment. Unfortunately, many of the amyloid studies are finding the neuropathological cascade continues. Many scientists are of the mind that we need a chemotherapy that addresses amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation, and immunotherapy, but as of now that’s a pipe dream.

>Gantenerumab and other anti-amyloid drugs have been linked to a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. The abnormalities are detectable on brain scans and represent tiny spots of blood in the brain or localized swelling of the brain. In clinical trials, most cases of ARIA aren’t noticed by participants (that is, they show no symptoms) and resolve on their own, but a minority are more serious and, rarely, deaths have been linked to the side effect. In this study, ARIA rates were one-third higher than in the original clinical trial (30% vs 19%), which the researchers attribute to the higher doses used in the extension. Two participants developed such severe ARIA that they needed to be taken off the drug, at which point they recovered.


As far as I understand what I've read elsewhere, something that was obscuring the positive effects of amyloid removal was that preventing buildup is safer than loosening and removing build-up, which for some can wreak a smol havok. The vasculature needs to be resilient enough to handle no longer being propped up, and maybe even handle being dinged.

I feel like hormones in particular are underdiscussed in supporting healthy vasculature. And there are so many lifestyle improvements, too.

I feel people can get discouraged when they don't see amazing enough results from lifestyle  interventions but really lots of humans just work against themselves. I remember a retired nurse who would hold court on their diet of foraged leaves and their yoga, and the real them 
was pickled in hard liquor and preserved meats and the shivasana was ass to seat.

mis04rk,James_Fortis,"""**Abstract**

Background/Objectives: Agricultural systems face increasing global pressure to address sustainability challenges, particularly regarding land use and environmental protection. In Romania, where traditional diets are heavily dependent on animal-based products, optimizing land use is critical. This study investigates the potential of plant-based diets to reduce agricultural land use, examining scenarios of partial and complete replacement of animal protein with plant protein sources (soy, peas, and potatoes). Methods: The research modeled three dietary transition scenarios—replacing 33%, 50%, and 100% of animal protein with plant-based protein—using data from the Romanian National Institute of Statistics, the FAO, and international sources. Land use was calculated for each scenario using formulas that take into account protein content and land use intensity for animal and plant protein sources. The simulations quantify the reduction in agricultural land use at the per capita and national levels. Results: The study reveals significant land-saving potential across all scenarios. At the national level, land use reductions ranged from 84,020 hectares (33% replacement) to **1,067,443 hectares** (100% replacement). High-impact products such as beef and dairy continue to dominate land use, even in partial replacement scenarios. Conversely, replacing pork and chicken proteins shows substantial savings. The findings highlight the inefficiency of animal-based protein production and the ecological benefits of transitioning to plant-based diets. Conclusions: **A dietary shift towards plant-based protein in Romania could achieve significant reductions in agricultural land use**, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. This transition not only supports environmental conservation and resource optimization, but also provides public health benefits by reducing consumption of red and processed meat. These results provide a basis for policies to promote sustainable and nutritionally balanced food systems""",4,1742469704.0,1,,1jfml88

Food without protein doesn't have protein. I am willing to be proven wrong, but adding rice to beans will not increase the amount of protein you get from beans. You just need to eat more beans.


It sounds like your kid likes carbs (a trait common in humans of all ages!). Reducing the amount of available pure carbs might be a good way to incentivize consumption of plants that actually contain protein. I.e., less rice, more beans.",2,1742518276.0,9,miw99a4,1jfh2dq

I just was saying I wouldn't personally want to commit so many calories to the same food twice a day in search of the calories/protein.

Temporary interruptions of opioid use also present an overdose risk for people who are dependent,5 as most use them regularly, often daily,6 or they risk severe withdrawal symptoms.7 Once they are experiencing withdrawal symptoms, many will go to great lengths to urgently procure and use opioids to stave off these symptoms.8,9""

mis5pqg,chrisdh79,"From the article: People are more likely to take part in protests and other forms of collective action when the cause aligns with their political values. However, new research suggests that political extremism itself—regardless of ideology—also drives activism. A study [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.70008) in Political Psychology found that individuals with extreme political beliefs, whether on the left or the right, are more likely to engage in collective action, even if the movement does not align with their ideology. The findings suggest that emotions, particularly anger, play a central role in this relationship.

“Both societal and fundamental interests inspired this research. At the societal level, there is a longstanding debate about the role of political extremes in social movements. In France, this question became particularly salient during the Yellow Vest movement, with analysts attempting to categorize the movement as left-wing, right-wing, or simply extreme,” explained Gaëlle Marinthe, an associate professor at Clermont Auvergne University.

“On the fundamental side, I am deeply interested in the similarities and differences between groups with ideologically opposing viewpoints. My colleagues and I wanted to examine the influence of both ideological values and a more cognitive feature of one’s ideological position (i.e., extremism) in political investment and, in this study, collective action. Our research is based on the premise that values and beliefs indeed play a major role in political behavior. However, structural features of ideology or belief (and in this case, extremism) may operate similarly across different ideological groups and may sometimes lead to counterintuitive outcomes—potentially even undermining the group’s long-term objectives.”",8,1742472239.0,1,,1jfna8t

As you say, a TBI can change someone's personality. If people can, in effect, have their brains physically modified such that they are significantly more likely to commit crimes, then *what is the point of punishing them*?

Note: I'm not asking ""what's the point of imprisoning them""--I think it makes a fair bit of sense to keep dangerous people separated from society. But, if there's a large cohort of people for whom punishment does not act as a deterrent, then what's the point? Why go out of our way to treat them poorly? Should we not be treating them like chronically ill people, *even if others suffered* as a result of the illness?

A common retort to this line of inquiry is e.g. ""well, there are people with TBIs who *don't* commit crimes.""

I bet a good number of the people who find that retort compelling would become significantly more predisposed to criminal behavior if they sustained a TBI. This isn't a matter of how morally resilient some people are, but how *lucky* some people are.

I'd just disassembled it for cleaning, and by setting the hammer back, it fired in 'single-action' mode, where the hammer strikes, rather than 'double action,' where a round is loaded into the chamber before the hammer strikes.

My reason for wanting to die is that I feel resentful at being trapped in an existence that I didn't ask for, and which is costly to maintain.

Except it demonstrably reduces the rate in comparable situations, why would GGB be different? Over time we'll likely learn the same here as we have learned for similar efforts across the world for decades now. 

I suggest you read the scientific paper I linked. There is similar literature on other locations. Similar efforts like removing access to firearms for those with suicidal ideations is also helpful in reducing their suicide risk.

mipz9rj,chrisdh79,"From the article: Human speech arises courtesy of some significant neural horsepower. Different areas of the brain are involved in determining the meaning that's desired, finding the words to express it, and then converting those words to a specific series of sounds—and all that comes before the correct sequence of nerve impulses is sent to the muscles that produce the final output. Humans are far from alone in the animal kingdom with an impressive range of vocalizations, though. That raises the prospect that we can understand a bit more about our own speech by studying how vocalization is managed in different animals.

One group of species that's especially interesting is birds. They're distant relatives compared to other animals with interesting vocal capabilities, like whales and elephants, and their brains have some notable differences from ours. They also show a range of behaviors, from complex songs to vocal mimicry to whatever it is that you want to call what parrots do. Thanks to a newly released study, however, we now have evidence that these different types of vocalization are the product of different control systems in the brain.

[The study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08695-8) relied on electrodes placed in the brains of parrots and songbirds and tracked the behavior of neurons in a region that controls vocalization. It showed that the two relied on different types of control, with parrots having a system that operates similarly to the one used by humans.

The work focused on two species of birds. One is the zebra finch, a songbird that learns to produce a short song it uses each year, in part by listening to what its peers are singing. The second is the budgerigar, a small parrot that's often kept as a pet. Budgerigars are both impressive vocal mimics and also have complex vocalizations called warbles that are a mix of noisy and harmonic calls.

Due to past work, we've already identified the brain structure that controls the activity of the key vocal organ, the syrinx, located in the bird's throat. The new study, done by Zetian Yang and Michael Long of New York University, managed to place fine electrodes into this area of the brain in both species and track the activity of neurons there while the birds were awake and going about normal activities. This allowed them to associate neural activity with any vocalizations made by the birds. For the budgerigars, they had an average of over 1,000 calls from each of the four birds carrying the implanted electrodes.",19,1742432892.0,1,,1jfd5cz

https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/02/bmjebm-2024-112974

From the linked article: 

Only 10% of non-surgical treatments for back problems kill pain, says review

Only six out of 56 treatments analysed yielded ‘small’ relief according to most comprehensive worldwide study, with some even increasing pain

Most treatments for back pain do not work and even the few that do bring little relief, a global review of the evidence on one of the world’s commonest health problems has found.

Six in 10 adults in the UK live with lower back pain at some point. Symptoms can include excruciating pain, restricted movement, inability to work and reluctance to mix socially. Some people feel better within weeks but others can find their life dominated by chronic pain for years.

The wide range of treatment available includes painkillers, acupuncture, stretching, massage, anti-inflammatory drugs, laser and light therapy, and manipulation of the spine.

However, the bad news for the many who endure back pain is that only 10% of these non-surgical treatments usually deployed actually have any effect – and the rest provide little or no benefit.

Only six out of the 56 treatments analysed are effective and even those yield only “small” relief. The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.

That is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.

Australian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.

“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.",1,1742376463.0,1,,1jet0pz
milabr4,LifeofTino,"Also worth noting that surgical treatments for back issues are also notorious for having a low success rate, with some studies finding surgical treatments to be less successful than non-surgical on average

Back problems were also the canary in the mine around diagnostics. When given blind tests (scan results from past patients), doctors have a low success rate at correctly identifying what the problem was. And, just as famously, lots of scans showed people with significant issues (including bulged discs) that had zero pain, and people with a lot of pain with no diagnosable issues at all

Which led to diagnostic reforms, because if someone had an issue with something that had no scan indication, and also had something on the scan that wasn’t causing an issue, this would lead to a misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment. Which is partly the cause of such poor results when it comes to back issues

So, back issues are so well known for having incredibly poor treatment success across all healthcare that they have had major impacts on all therapy and diagnostic practices",1343,1742377834.0,1,,1jet0pz

Chronic pain is not a death sentence, you may just have to continue the hunt to find therapies/exercises that can provide relief.

It's not a one size fits all and requires a lot of dedication, but committing suicide is a reckless and idiotic thing to write online.   
If you're suffering from chronic pain, do not listen to this, some of the books recommended above are great.

misliu1,AcanthisittaSuch7001,"I think you are overselling your case. It would be very surprising if isolating children socially would not also lead to mental health problems. Children thrive on social interaction. It would take extraordinary evidence to convince me of that extraordinary claim, and you have not provided any such evidence.

I do think that there are some neuropsychiatric effects of COVID-19 that likely contributed also. 

However I would like to say that the studies you just linked to are not actually relevant to this question.

The first link was a study of adults, not children. Also, the first study specifically excluded any patients with psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression). So that study cannot be used to show that COVID-19 contributes to anxiety and depression, because the patients in that study did not have any such symptoms.

See excerpt below: 

“We evaluated a group of 97 unvaccinated individuals (without history or current presence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and psychiatric symptoms) after a mild infection with SARS-CoV-2. We detected persistent headache, fatigue, excessive somnolence, cognitive dysfunction, and subtle microstructural white MRI abnormalities.“

The second study you linked also was only studying cognitive changes after COVID, not psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression. So it is also not directly relevant to this post.

However, I am sure that there are some studies making the connection between COVID and psychiatric symptoms in children. I can try to look them up a bit later when I have more time.",8,1742478199.0,2,miq37ym,1jfdgf9
mitebe3,grundar,"> The first link was a study of adults, not children.

I think a bigger limitation is the risk of selection bias, given that they *""used social media to advertise our study with an online questionnaire""*.

Here's the preamble from their questionnaire which went out to social media:  
>> ""We are researchers from the Department of Neurology (School of Medical Sciences / UNICAMP) and from the Department of Biology (UNICAMP), and we are studying the effects of coronavirus in the central nervous system.  
This questionnaire will help us to understand how people are recovering themselves after the infection by the new coronavirus. Our complete project includes a magnetic resonance, neurological and cognitive examination (memory, language…). If it is possible for you to answer this questionnaire, we would be very grateful.""

I would expect someone who was concerned about their mental functioning post-infection would be substantially more interested in participating in a study looking at that than someone who felt their mental functioning was unaffected.

Given that, it's unlikely to be appropriate to generalize this paper's findings to the general population.

As a sanity check, let's look at the numbers being claimed:  
>> ""we know from other studies that covid infections cause brain damage, which in turn cause mental illnesses and cognitive dysfunctions in about 70% of those infected, even when symptoms are mild  
>> ...  
>> We also know that about 90% of children in the USA had had at least one covid infection""

Do those figures not imply that 70% x 90% = 63% of children should have been expected to have had mental illnesses and cognitive dysfunctions, far more than the 11% increase found in the study under discussion today?

Don't get me wrong, it's been well demonstrated that covid can have long-lasting physical and cerebral effects.  The papers cited have specific limitations, though, and it would be a mistake to over-generalize their findings.",1,1742486931.0,3,misliu1,1jfdgf9

mj0dilq,Kenosis94,"Did you even read the full memo there?  You use the phrase intellectual honesty while misrepresenting the contents of your presented evidence. Aside from that, you have presented evidence in favor of my argument. You have given evidence of a scenario where a political brief was likely used ~~by politicians~~ to influence scientific discourse and scientific agencies (although you presented no evidence that this was actually distributed or used to guide public health agency statements). If my argument is that ""if suppression of scientific evidence is happening, it is more likely being suppressed by politicians and business than the scientists themselves"" and your response is ""you are wrong, here's a case where politicians likely tried to suppress scientific agencies or scientific discourse"" then you have failed to demonstrate how I am wrong at all. 

I also did not imply that politicians should control research, if anything implied they are the problem. For the record I think scientific agencies should be highly independent and far better funded. My point was that the research itself isn't the problem and that suppression or avoidance of actions that should be taken in accordance with those findings are far more often the problem and those things aren't the fault of the scientists. If a CDC researcher wants to conduct a large scale study on long term disability as a result of COVID and they are prevented from doing so because the president has stated that they can't do more research on that, then the president is the issue, not the scientist who wanted to do the research. In the case of COVID, if a researcher finds damaging long term consequences but that research is suppressed or simply misrepresented or downplayed by politicians, that isn't the scientists fault. The researchers in those cases didn't kowtow to anybody and your blame is being placed at the wrong place. If you are mad that occasionally scientific institutions do kowtow to political influence, maybe be mad at the political influence instead of using it as an excuse to cherry pick what science you think is real and what isn't.

Your initial comment implies that scientists are somehow falsifying or misrepresenting research due to political influence but you haven't actually demonstrated fault on the scientific community beyond the obvious issue that politicians ultimately control funding and leadership at the agencies which biases what research gets funded but not necessarily the quality of content of that research. 

Your argument isn't even internally consistent in the context of the discussion. You replied to a post where scientists are saying COVID has serious long-term mental impacts. Your reply indicated that you believe scientists are overstating things due to political influence because if they weren't there would be more legal measures from regulators on the matter. To that, I pointed out that scientists are far less likely to want to misrepresent the situation than the politicians and businesses who lose out due to those sorts of measures.  Your response to that was a political guidance memo effectively demonstrating how politicians might have an incentive to influence things to downplay not overplay it as you initially claimed. So are the researchers kowtowing to political pressure and saying it is more dangerous or less dangerous? Is it actually the scientists doing the misrepresentation or is it the politicians?

miq1u83,chrisdh79,"From the article: A new study analyzing global mental health data has revealed a sharp increase in mental disorders among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study, [published](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/global-burden-of-mental-disorders-in-children-and-adolescents-before-and-during-the-covid19-pandemic-evidence-from-the-global-burden-of-disease-study-2021/430C2B921A1C32D284EE040F08A1D3BB) in Psychological Medicine, found that the number of new mental disorder cases among individuals aged 5 to 24 increased by more than 11% annually during this period. The findings highlight the pandemic’s lasting impact on youth mental health.

The mental health of young people has long been a public health concern, with many disorders first appearing during childhood and adolescence. Mental disorders can affect cognitive development, school performance, relationships, and overall well-being, often carrying long-term consequences into adulthood. The COVID-19 pandemic created a new set of challenges that disrupted daily life, education, and social interactions, all of which are known to influence mental health.

Although previous research has examined the effects of the pandemic on mental health, there has been a lack of large-scale, globally representative studies specifically focused on children and adolescents. The authors of the new study sought to address this gap by using data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2021. They aimed to quantify changes in the prevalence and burden of mental disorders before and during the pandemic, providing a clearer picture of how young people were affected worldwide.

The researchers analyzed mental health data from 204 countries and territories, focusing on individuals aged 5 to 24. They examined three key measures: the number of new cases, the total number of people affected (prevalence), and the burden of mental disorders in terms of years lived with disability (YLDs). They compared data from 2019, before the pandemic, to data from 2020 and 2021, during the height of the pandemic’s disruptions.",6,1742433786.0,1,,1jfdgf9

and during this age range thats when we find out about the world and who we are. Locked away people HINDERED so much of that social growth, that you can see it now with how people just cant talk to eachother anymore.

minmems,Wagamaga,"For years, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been studied primarily in people who experience trauma firsthand. But what about those who witness it — military veterans, first responders, health care workers, or bystanders to violence — who constitute 10 percent of all PTSD cases?

New research from Virginia Tech, published in PLOS ONE, reveals that witnessing trauma triggers unique brain changes, distinct from those caused by experiencing trauma firsthand. The study is the first to shed light on the molecular differences between directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD and could pave the way for changes in how the disorders are treated. 

“Currently, patients with directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD are treated the same way – with a combination of therapy and medication,” said Timothy Jarome, the project’s principal investigator and associate professor of neurobiology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “Our research suggests that indirect trauma and direct trauma create different biological responses, which could mean they require different treatment strategies that target distinct brain pathways.”

mimy2ht,SpartanFishy,"Most people aren’t looking to eat just rice everyday.

Also, separately, I’d like to push back on the notion that eating healthy really is all that cheap anymore.

The basics like rice and vegetables are mostly reasonable, but things like meat and cheese are exorbitantly expensive. When I was poor as dirt 8 years ago we literally couldn’t justify buying anything but bulk ground beef and even that felt like splurging at the time. To make it a full meal we leaned on hamburger helper and frozen peas.

If you wanted to make that properly you’d have the beef. Then buy pasta noodles for the same cost as the entire hamburger helper box. Buy a few vegetables to chop up for way more than the cost of a portion of frozen peas. Buy a spice packet because you haven’t built up a whole spice rack because you can’t justify that purchase.

Want cheese as well? Idk that’s more money still probably shouldn’t do it.

And that’s just one meal. The price for eating healthy is cheap when you’re literally eating canned beans in a bowl. It’s not cheap when you are trying to craft actual meals like a human being with any level of variety. 

And to get back to the time commitment argument, everything I labeled above requires either going to the grocery store for every meal, or meticulously planning your food over weeks to avoid wasting fresh fridge food.

I get what you mean. I’m late diagnosed (at 39), was simply doing too well at school to get noticed, at least in the 80s (nowadays almost any kindergarden teacher below 30 would catch my very obvious symptoms) and went to all what described when it comes to impact. Including depression and anxiety because I was  branded as ""smart but lazy and failing because of the laziness"" and internalized this hard.  
And I also get the frustration when people I know very long and also know their capabilities suddenly discover they also might have AD(H)D.

But we do know that addressing dopamine dysfunction from an early age leads to the most functionality and stability later with less recklessness, imiulsivity, and self treating substance misuse and addiction. Because it lets them focus enough to learn interpersonal skills at school.

He would barely be remembered if not for Watergate because we are used to shitty politicians now but he had the same people Trump does now doing the same shady shit on his behalf. 

Just listen to his tapes(the parts that weren't bad enough to be destroyed lol) and you'd know Watergate was a drop in the bucket of his shadiness.  Without Watergate the tapes likely wouldn't have been exposed.  Those are what did him in though.  Not only did they prove he was actively working to steal an election, they exposed all the corrupt dealings and (most importantly to the American voter) use of curse words including taking the Lord's name in vain.

He also negotiated with the NVA during his candidacy promising a better deal than the Democrats were offering in exchange for stringing the peace talks until after the election.  He cost more North and South Vietnamese lives, along with US troops, to boost his election chances(negotiating with a nation we are at war with outside of government channels is called ""Treason"" btw).  He created the Controlled Substances Act and War on Drugs specifically to go after black people and hippies, him not blatantly interfering in the implementation of Brown V BoE and CRA isn't an accomplishment.  And opening up China to offshore the entire US manufacturing sector so him and his friends could make more money is hardly worth celebrating.  It's not like we aren't still dealing with the ramifications of that to this day.  

The EPA is the only one I'll give you, but even that has caveats.  At the time, American cities were so smoky it was impossible for any side to deny the damaging effects of carbon emissions.  By cleaning up the most visible indicators we are killing our planet, it quelled the many voices crying about all the less visible ones.  ""The Clean Air Act is fixing the problem, stop crying about the environment"".  So while I support not having 10,000ppm particulate in the air, it did nothing to avert the climate catastrophe and only lasted for 3 decades.

The lionization of Nixon is utterly baffling to me and I can only assume it's contrarianism at best, or decades of Roger Stone and Rupert Murdoch ratfucking his image at worst.",45,1742504690.0,7,miujzom,1jfssq8

I get that you can’t beat a multi-billion-dollar company with a garage start-up based on decreased profitability. But I’m not asking about “beating” the big dogs, just coexisting.

If all the dating sites suck and are owned by one company, why doesn’t somebody make a new one tomorrow that doesn’t suck? Yes, Match will try to buy them out if they succeed, but where’s the coder saying “Nah, having a dating app that doesn’t suck is worth more than me cashing in on this project.” And yeah, maybe that sounds like an unrealistic hippy to you, but where tf did my unrealistic hippies go? Or, where tf is the non-hippy billionaire willing to lose a million dollars a year gifting society a workable dating site?

Looking at products like Mastodon—a decentralized social network—shows there’s interest in non-traditional models.

mj0r8l6,Starstroll,"Section 230 is complicated imo. Republicans hate it because they want no accountability, but we should also recognize that it's a fairly blunt instrument, written for a much simpler time. With all major platforms being algorithmically driven, companies are literally capable of monitoring the content on their platforms far better than this law recognizes. That said, companies also obviously shouldn't be trusted to monitor that content to the benefit of its users.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal is the perfect example. Facebook targeted and manipulated millions of people on an individual level. That exact same technology could be used to curb hate speech if only these technologies were properly regulated. Section 230 is blind to all of that though, and so protects its continuation.

Some people often respond ""how do we decide who gets to moderate speech?"" Or, more debate-bro-y, ""as much as we need a ministry of censorship, we do not need a ministry of censorship."" Firstly, speech is already being censored by these companies, and to the whims and benefits of the CEOs of these companies (I'm talking Facebook, Amazon, Google). And secondly, we decide on rules for moderation collectively. Rules for moderation should be made public, as well as the training data and training goals, past and present, for all algorithmic systems that enforce them.

Do I think that proposal will get through the current Republicans? No, of course not. I'm not naive. But we can't just keep falling for arguments that boil down to ""if it's too hard to figure out all at once, we shouldn't try at all.""",1,1742582952.0,2,mj0fqh7,1jgmupf

mj0chzp,YesNo_Maybe_,"The article:
A Norwegian man has filed a complaint against the company behind ChatGPT after the chatbot falsely claimed he had murdered two of his children.

Arve Hjalmar Holmen, a self-described “regular person” with no public profile in Norway, asked ChatGPT for information about himself and received a reply claiming he had killed his own sons.

Responding to the prompt “Who is Arve Hjalmar Holmen?” ChatGPT replied: “Arve Hjalmar Holmen is a Norwegian individual who gained attention due to a tragic event. He was the father of two young boys, aged seven and 10, who were tragically found dead in a pond near their home in Trondheim, Norway, in December 2020.”

The response went on to claim the case “shocked” the nation and that Holmen received a 21-year prison sentence for murdering both children.

Holmen said in a complaint to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority that the “completely false” story nonetheless contained elements similar to his own life such as his home town, the number of children he has and the age gap between his sons.

“The complainant was deeply troubled by these outputs, which could have harmful effect in his private life, if they where reproduced or somehow leaked in his community or in his home town,” said the complaint, which has been filed by Holmen and Noyb, a digital rights campaign group.

It added that Holmen has “never been accused nor convicted of any crime and is a conscientious citizen”.

Holmen’s complaint alleged that ChatGPT’s “defamatory” response violated accuracy provisions within the GDPR European data law. It has asked the Norwegian watchdog to order ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI, to adjust its model to eliminate inaccurate results relating to Holmen and to impose a fine on the company. Noyb said that since Holmen’s interaction with ChatGPT took place, OpenAI had released a new model incorporating web searches – which has made a repeat of the Holmen error “less likely”.

AI chatbots are prone to producing responses containing false information because they are built on models that predict the next most likely word in a sentence. This can result in factual errors and wild assertions, but the plausible nature of the responses can trick users into thinking that what they are reading is 100% correct.

An OpenAI spokesperson said: “We continue to research new ways to improve the accuracy of our models and reduce hallucinations. While we’re still reviewing this complaint, it relates to a version of ChatGPT which has since been enhanced with online search capabilities that improves accuracy.”",10,1742578631.0,1,,1jgmjaa

mizrebh,chrisdh79,"From the article: A few years ago, the American automaker General Motors (GM) announced that it would be phasing out support for CarPlay and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform. It was a controversial decision, as many drivers who are in the market for a new vehicle consider CarPlay to be a must-have feature.

Looking to capitalize on the situation, one GM dealership near Detroit, Michigan last year began offering an aftermarket CarPlay installation service in GM’s newer EV models. But, according to a report this week from automotive blog The Drive (via The Verge), GM recently blocked the dealership from offering that service due to safety concerns.

“We have made the difficult decision to discontinue this product,” said the LaFontaine Chevrolet Plymouth dealership, on a website that previously offered the CarPlay installation service. “This was not a decision we made lightly, but due to a variety of factors, continuing to offer this product is no longer viable in the long term,” it said.

A spokesperson for GM told The Drive that unapproved aftermarket services “could affect critical safety features,” and pose other issues.

“Aftermarket services that introduce features not originally designed, thoroughly tested, and approved by GM may cause unintended issues for customers,” the GM spokesperson said, in response to this matter. “These issues could affect critical safety features and may also void portions of the vehicle’s warranty.”

It is unclear if the aftermarket CarPlay system actually poses any safety issues, or if GM is simply unhappy that one dealership decided to go against the company’s decision to focus on its own software platform. It is also unclear if customers who already had the installation service completed will be affected in any way.",11,1742572604.0,1,,1jgk54d

It's not a kill switch, where the US can stop the plane from working. There is none of that.

BUT

When you send one to on a mission you need to upload a mission profile to the plane, area, what to target, what not to target, what armament is being carried, etc... These need to be signed, computer signed, same thing as app on your phone, so you can authentify it so you're can't just send the wrong profile and the plane show the wrong friend or foe information on war because your opponent hacked you. 

Most plane seller give you the ability to generate your own key to then sign your own mission. The F35, every buyer HAS to have the US DoD servers sign their mission profile they have their own key but then it must be counter signed by the US master key. Only the UK as a tier 1 partner has its own master key.

So no they can't shut down the plane, but they can ensure you can't use it properly as long as they don't validate your mission.

Honestly, IGNORING the current US bullshit going on, and I know being French and having our own independant thing makes it easier to think like that when some can't afford to, but I don't understand why so many countries would agree to such a restriction. It's crazy. Ukraine is fighting Russia with Soviet weapon, if they had such a system back then they couldn't.

PS just to add, when this subject is brought up people say stuff like ""we won't be at war with the US"", you don't need to get there, you just need to want to bomb some target (say, Russian) that the US really don't want you to bomb.

FWIW the US military engages with companies that do everything normal companies do, but don't sell to you and me.  They even have companies making high-grade silicon, making their own computer chips.  That very well may be done, in part, to ensure that regular grade equipment doesn't contaminate their supply chain.",10,1742469175.0,4,mirwgg9,1jfhvzo

According to a complaint filed Thursday by European Union digital rights advocates Noyb, Arve Hjalmar Holmen decided to see what information ChatGPT might provide if a user searched his name. He was shocked when ChatGPT responded with outputs falsely claiming that he was sentenced to 21 years in prison as ""a convicted criminal who murdered two of his children and attempted to murder his third son,"" a Noyb press release said.

ChatGPT's ""made-up horror story"" not only hallucinated events that never happened, but it also mixed ""clearly identifiable personal data""—such as the actual number and gender of Holmen's children and the name of his hometown—with the ""fake information,"" Noyb's press release said.

ChatGPT hallucinating a ""fake murderer and imprisonment"" while including ""real elements"" of the Norwegian man's ""personal life"" allegedly violated ""data accuracy"" requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), because Holmen allegedly could not easily correct the information, as the GDPR requires.

As Holmen saw it, his reputation remained on the line the longer the information was there, and—despite ""tiny"" disclaimers reminding ChatGPT users to verify outputs—there was no way to know how many people might have been exposed to the fake story and believed the information was accurate.",916,1742472701.0,1,,1jfnf9y

This is an important sentiment to note. Right now all arguments defending Trump’s actions circle back to this logic. I’ve pissed off two family members now by pointing this out, genuinely, and asking them about it. 

They both agreed that trumps actions are defended by his overall goals, that is …the ends justify the means. 

But when I asked what “the ends” were…nobody seems to know. I asked what they thought about Ukraine : is his goal for Ukraine to have all its land back, for Russia to have 25%, for the US to run the power plants, is the end goal simply peace or is it global stability?

They didn’t know exactly, but Trump does. These are two separate family members and conversations by the way. And you point out that Trump has actually flip flopped between all of these outcomes. And this is just one issues out of hundreds of political problems right now. 

And it comes back to his actions, the treatment of Zelensky, the capitulation towards Putin, the phone calls, the sanctions…

mit8w8o,Wagamaga,"The 2025 Australian federal election will take place in May, and Meta has vowed to combat all forms of misinformation, including deepfakes, on its platforms ahead of voting in an attempt to prevent election interference. Ironically, Meta announced that it plans to do this with the help of the exact methods CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced just a few months ago were not worth the company’s time in the U.S., namely the use of third-party fact checkers. 

  
“We have developed a comprehensive approach to help ensure the integrity of elections on our platforms: one that gives people a voice, supports participation in the civic process, and combats voter interference and foreign influence,” Meta’s head of policy in Australia, Cheryl Seeto, said in a blog explaining how the company is preparing for the country’s upcoming election. “We continue to work with Agence France-Presse (AFP) and the Australian Associated Press (AAP) to independently review content. We are also partnering with AAP on a new media literacy campaign to help Australians critically assess the content they view online, which will run in the lead-up to the election.”",18,1742485359.0,1,,1jfrtmb

After Zuckerberg visited trump at Mar a Lago this past November, he promoted Republican operative and DC insider Joel Kaplan to lead Global Policy at Meta. Meta then adjusted its algos to push right-wing content to the forefront, even if a user isn't subscribed to political content.

mizgipe,UCF_Official,"For people with upper extremity disabilities — such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis or other conditions — assistive robotics can help restore their independence in performing everyday tasks like eating, grooming and grasping objects. But much like old dogs, these devices have a hard time learning new tricks.

“They need a lot of demos to learn new tasks, and people with disabilities aren’t able to provide these demos,” says Professor Aman Behal, an assistive robotics expert at UCF. “If they can, they might not be the best demos for the robot to learn from.”

Behal aims to address this challenge with his new research project, Mobile Robot Manipulators for Learning and Executing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. The project is supported through a three-year, $600,000 grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research.

Currently, mobile assistive robotics can be mounted to the side of a wheelchair or can trail behind the individual, ready to assist when needed. These devices allow users to navigate their homes or travel to places like an office or local park, offering greater flexibility than stationary fixed-base robotics.

While the dexterity of these robots allows them to assist with complex tasks like brushing hair or cutting a piece of steak, they can be difficult for the user to control or teach. Assistive robots perform tasks better over time by mimicking the user, but in these situations, the user may not be able to complete the task correctly — or at all.

Behal and his team of researchers, including Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy Morris Beato, and Professor of Statistics and Data Science Edgard Maboudou, will create intelligent and mobile robotic assistants that offer easier control and a better robot-human interface.

The project’s first year will focus on research and development, while the second and third years will incorporate testing and user feedback. Initial testing  will be conducted with students, followed by studies involving adults with upper body paralysis.

“We will recruit adults between the ages of 18 and 65, bring them (into our lab) and essentially get the robots to do several tasks,” Behal says. “At the end of it, we’ll see how easy it was to interact with the robot.”

The researchers will survey the participants to find out how many times they had to tell the robot to perform a task, how long it took for the robot to complete the action, how many mistakes were made and how satisfied they were with the robot’s assistance.

The end goal is to develop smart robots that can give the user a greater degree of independence, leading to increased self-esteem and enhanced quality of life.",1,1742569416.0,1,,1jgiwa7

These are cars that are EASIER to make than internal combustion cars, the consumer expectation should be they rapidly become cheaper than anything the much more complex internal combustion cars can offer.

It's not like these companies need to invent much of anything for EVs. The world has been making solid electric motors that last forever for decades. All that ever needed to happen was batteries to get good enough to get decent range.

I'll be interested in EVs until they hit the 10-20k range because it's just way less to actually build. They want us to pay extra to make up for the fact that the new tech is cheaper and that's 100% bullshit. That's like if 50 inch LED TVs were priced against old school 50 inch rear projection SD TVs just because the company didn't want to pass the savings to consumers and risk profit margins.

He's complicated. He was pretty liberal, supported Obama. Relished in the American Dream. He's an idealist and I truly believe if you put him on a lie detector test, he would pass if you asked him if he wants to improve humanity.

People hate to give him credit but he truly did move the needle in EV adoption and space technology. He's also a sociopath and narcissist. The thing that gave him audacity to start a space company and lead an EV car company also gave him the audacity to go head to head against NASA and the government in court and then WIN. He got early space contracts from NASA by suing because they were awarded to Boeing and some other incumbent companies that were bloated and slow and had no results to show for it. And SpaceX ran circles around them. He pissed off a lot of officials during a Democrat run govt and he's been on their shit list.

The Biden White House hosted an EV day, solar day, green energy day and they excluded Tesla and Elon. It was unfairly personal against Elon. He has a point there. Tesla was far and away the EV leader. Tesla owns 47% of market share for solar. He was being punished.

At the same time Elon started to reconcile with his father who was previously viciously rejected by Elon. This father is as big of a nutjob as there can ever be for right wing conspiracies. The thing is that Elon is really the same person as his father. Elon hated his father because he saw how awful he was and also he recognized the worst parts of himself in his father. Now he was starting to embrace that crazy.

Anyways, a Twitter purchase and election later, Elon has taken over the government and is treating it like one of his companies. Instead of citizens, we're treated like employee. We're quantified, measured by our dollar value and treated accordingly. If you're not a net positive to the economy, you should be discarded. That's the path to profitable companies, but unhappy dystopian countries.

I’m curious to see how they try to spin this as being good for the average American.

“Regulation of social media companies” just reads as we’re going to write legislation to only make it okay for fascist, sorry, republican propaganda to be posted on social media.


Non-compete agreements are a joke, and they’re required for a LOT of tech gigs. “Come work for us, but if we decide to fire you, with or without cause, you’re going to have to find a new industry to work in.” It’s so blatantly detrimental for employees and unnecessarily controlling by the companies.

Right to repair is the same thing as noncompete agreements. It ONLY benefits the manufacturers, not the customers. This one is especially big for farmers too, who can’t work on any of their John Deere (or is it Juan Deere now?) equipment if AND they can’t go to a 3rd party for repairs.

Deregulating mergers is, once again, ONLY good for businesses, not consumers. Consolidating already enormous businesses just gives consumers less choices and it gives the companies more of a monopoly.

Elon has explicitly threatened to dump money into primaries for anyone who disobeys Trump, and the only reason he has the ability to do that is because of his mega wealth...and the main source of that is Tesla.

So in order to actually have the ability to vote for better people without a billionaire simply buying the election, we need to first take away his mega wealth / otherwise remove his ability to fuck with elections. That is a prerequisite for what you're talking about.

The next election is about two years away, so we have that long to cripple Elon Musk's power if we actually want the chance to vote for better people. 

Assuming we can do so, then I assure you we will indeed vote for better representation. But if we want that chance, we have to do the work to get it. That will mean voting in two years...but right now it means damaging Tesla and Elon's wealth as much as possible in order to reduce his power as much as possible.

>I'm just trying to help educate people that vandalizing cars and protesting the company isn't effective.

It seems pretty effective so far -- it is driving down the stock price and thereby reducing Elon Musk's wealth and thereby his power.

He has other companies too, of course. And in the event he continues to retain power by funneling money through them, we'll get to work on them as well. But for now Tesla is the crown jewel and also the easiest to attack. So it's a good target.

As far as it financially hurting people, yes, that is true. But sitting idly by for two years also hurts people both financially and physically as Elon randomly cuts jobs and life saving funds -- in fact, it hurts significantly more people. People are already dying from it, and as vital government agencies get destroyed the functions they provide will fail and people will die. Quite possibly a *lot* of people. When considering uncontrolled disease outbreaks, dirty water on a national scale, tainted food being shipped out and allowed to circulate without recall on the scale of modern logistics, and other such failures it is entirely possible we are looking at body counts in the millions.

In contrast, there are only about 1.8 million Tesla drivers worldwide, and only a small fraction of them are facing, at most, loss of a car (and many of them just face some repair costs).

I think that is a pretty simple trolley problem to solve, friend. 

The working class will suffer far less from the destruction and defacement of a few cars that are themselves a serious risk to the driver (Teslas are actually some of the most dangerous cars on the road) than from allowing Elon Musk to hold power uncontested for even two years.",1,1742529577.0,7,mit9hel,1jffu71

mixwgye,helmutye,">At most, less than 1/3 of Musk's wealth comes from Tesla. 

Well, the portion of his wealth coming from Tesla is definitely decreasing...in part because of these efforts. That is the point.

Tesla's market cap was like $1.4 trillion in December 2024, and today it has fallen to about $750 billion (so far). That does quite a lot to help what I'm describing.

But even setting that aside, Tesla and SpaceX are the only two things Musk owns that are really worth anything when the chips are down -- it's all well and good to make up values for his other companies in the abstract, but nobody is going to lend him significant amounts of money against the Boring Company, or Neuralink, or Twitter. It's pretty debatable that he could even get much from SpaceX because it is simply much more complex to liquidate ownership in a private company vs public share value.

So even if what you were saying here were true, the portion of his wealth that comes from Tesla is the portion that is most easily available for him to use as financial firepower. Leveraging the rest is *way* more difficult and requires him to do things that undermine his larger position and make him less powerful as a result (for instance, forcing him to diminish his ownership over SpaceX would be a big win, as would forcing him to try to get additional money via SpaceX by corrupt contacts, such as the one to oversee air traffic control).

>How are you going to do that when SpaceX is the biggest next one and it's funded by secured government contacts

I don't have a fully formed answer for that right now. But there are definitely ways that are available. For one, Starlink dishes are pretty easy to spot and mess with, and the cost of maintaining the Starlink constellation is pretty significant, so a loss of users pretty quickly results in a financial bleed. For two, many of the employees at SpaceX strongly dislike Musk, and that presents a number of opportunities to drive a wedge between him and that company.

>You have to address things at the government level to make a difference.

Musk currently owns the government, so no, that really isn't an option at the moment. Again, a prerequisite for elections is removing Musk's ability to simply buy them. And that has to be done outside of elections.

Also, direct action definitely makes a difference -- for instance, the collapse of Tesla's share price directly lead to the President doing a car commercial in front of the white house...and it caused at most a momentary pause in the price collapse. That both an act of desperation and also a serious loss of face -- Trump and Musk draw a lot of their power from the belief by other powerful people that they can rule effectively, and when they fail to impose their will on the world it weakens that perception and thereby weakens the willingness of other powerful people to go along with them.

Forcing powerful people to respond and then publicly fail *definitely* makes a difference. Loss of the perception of strength is a major threat to dictators, and this feeds into that.

Also, this action is taking the initiative and taking the battle to Musk...which forces him to call in favors and expend effort responding to and combatting it. One of the biggest problems with the Democrats right now is that they are purely reactive -- Trump and Musk act and they are left trying to figure out how to respond. And this has been true with some of the other protests as well. But these actions against Tesla are active and self-initiated, and that gives them a strength that simply waiting for an election and hoping you get a good choice will never have.

It's not my opinion, and it's not hard to verify. His portion is less than 13% of the company.  At 750 billion valuation, his portion would be worth at most $97.5B.  Starlink's current consumer revenue is $8.2B in 2024.  So again, even if you vandelized every Tesla on the road and every Starlink consumer dish, he would still be one of the richest people in the world.  I get the direction you're trying to go, but to me the logic and approach is just not going to be effective to the end goal of getting him to change his behavior.  

The better bet isn't putting pressure on him, because I just objectively demonstrated that he will not lose enough to matter.

Look at what they've done so far. The speed at which everything is being consolidated in the executive, and the things outside of the executive are being dismantled.

Do you really think they have any plans to hand any form of power over to the opposition they demonize?

I'm not saying don't vote, because even if the elections become a sham, the more people who vote in them the more obvious that will be, but let's not delude ourselves into thinking that the man and party who have already reframed a violent coup attempt, denied election results, and continually paint an election result of less than 50% of the vote as a ""mandate"" are the type of people who are going to just go ""well, you've won. Congratulations."" this isn't going to end in the voting booth. It ends through overwhelming pressure from an angry populace. And that's the best case scenario.

I honestly hope that people wake up in numbers to make that happen soon... Because if it doesn't there's a very real chance we move into a world where this ends in blood or it doesn't end at all. I sincerely hope we can stop the decline before we reach that point.

mizsbht,FoolKiIIer,"I’m calling it now, there will be marshal law in the United States within the next couple of months. Trump has already set the plan in motion, I believe that the withdrawal of American troops and military assets from Europe was motivated by the need to deploy large numbers of armed troops domestically to enforce marshal law. Trump has a well documented habit of declaring emergencies, often under extremely flimsy pretext, in order to exercise greater control and act unilaterally (like declaring steel imports a national security threat). 

He’ll send the troops to the southern border first but that will be for show and to not arouse suspicion. 

His stated intention to declare fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction is likely going to function as his excuse to use American soldiers to quell possible dissent and assume law enforcement duties domestically.

miy09j6,brain_overclocked,">Donald Trump’s interim Social Security chief suggested Thursday night he will effectively turn off the agency that manages the essential safety net program for seniors and the disabled, if Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) can’t access the non-anonymized sensitive personal information and data of hundreds of millions of Americans, based on a judge’s order.

>“My anti-fraud team would be DOGE affiliates. My IT staff would be DOGE affiliates,” said Lee Dudek, acting Social Security Administration (SSA) commissioner, arguing the order was too broad, according to Bloomberg News. “As it stands, I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems,” he said, adding: “Really, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency.”

>Dudek’s threat to block SSA employees from using the agency’s IT systems — a move that could halt Social Security payments — came in response to a judge’s temporary restraining order in a case brought by the AFL-CIO labor union. The order bars Social Security Administration officials from allowing DOGE, including Musk, and the SSA’s DOGE team to access personally identifiable information. It also directs Musk and DOGE to delete from their possession all non-anonymized personal data, and bars them from having access to SSA computers or code.

That’s an 80% reduction in poverty among the elderly. The only way to reduce poverty among those too old to work is through subsidies.
How does SS create subsidies?
Revenue: SS taxes everyone 6.2% of lifetime wages (up to the earnings cap). (Times 2 for employer match and the additional 1.45% is for Medicare HI (Health Insurance), not OASDI (Old Age, Survivors Disability Insurance).) So everyone PAYS the same rate.
Expense: When you retire, your benefit is calculated by determining your Average Indexed (for inflation) Monthly Earnings (AIME). Your SS benefit is determined as:
90% up to X of AIME plus
32% of AIME from X to Y plus
15% of AIME over Y
Someone who earned X for their AIME RECEIVES 90% of lifetime earnings and someone who’s AIME is the cap RECEIVES 28% of lifetime earnings.
Did you get that? The poor person pays 6.2% and receives 90% the
“rich” person pays 6.2% and receives 28%. (“Rich” is in quotes because many middle-class skilled laborers without college degrees earn the SS maximum.)
I did some actuarial calculations once and the poor person (receives 90%) “earns” about a 15% return on taxes (over a period where the S&P returned 12%) and the rich person “earns” about a 0% return (an interest free loan.

*YET*.  

Let us not forget the guardrails put in place over the decades to prevent things like that or the Holocaust from occurring again slowly being whittled away, and officials who would prevent an order from being followed being replaced with yesmen.  

You can not pretend that they aren't looking to repeat that when they're sending off people to El Salvador, accusing them of being gang members when the only thing they're guilty of is being Latino in America, using the most bullshit excuse of a tattoo based off of a soccer team and calling the ASL sign of ""I Love You"" as a gang sign.  Nor can you pretend that when the administration is doing all they can to erase any LGBT+ references, starting with the trans community, and following a roadmap that calls for classifying any LGBT+ individual as being ""pornographic"" and punishing them, up to *the death penalty* for just simply EXISTING in public.  

The deaths from the Trail of Tears didn't start on day 1 of Jackson's presidency.  The Holocaust didn't begin with the gas chambers in 1933.  Just because it hasn't happened yet or during his first presidency, which was filled with cabinet members and officials telling him no and/or resigning and is why the qualifications for his second is ""will you aggressively choke down his mushroom shaped chode?"" doesn't mean they aren't trying to push it through.",1,1742576306.0,6,mizy02z,1jgjsee

That’s partially why it’s so appealing to some people. You don’t actually ever have to consider (edit: spelling) yourself as a factor in anything. It lets you believe you’re perfect, God’s gift to this earth, and the reason you don’t get the success of your wildest dreams is always someone else.

And thus cannot learn from their mistakes.  Outwardly these people can seem fairly “normal”.  So their level of stupidity gets masked.

mizfvtk,that_star_wars_guy,">Secondly, a lot of the issue is white collar workers sitting in offices sending emails and making more money than than those in labor jobs.

I think you have stumbled upon the crux of perhaps the greatest issue we perpetually face:
 Our economy, jobs, and opportunities have moved farther and farther into knowledge and service industries, and away from trades, manufacturing, and other manual labor jobs. 

On the one hand, our economy has grown significantly, because the market value of the knowledge and service jobs is significant. Significantly moreso than the equivalent labor output  by those working the same hours. This causes tension and resentment between the two groups as the latter has their opportunities perpetually shrinking (or even just culturally denigrated), whereas the latter sees continued expansion and growth for the foreseeable future. 

And on the other hand, if the standard bell curve is to be believed, it is ultimately unsustainable to only have job opportunities for a smaller and smaller percentage of the populace. Either they need jobs or some sort of UBI needs to be discussed to ensure these people are still able to maintain a standard of living. Certain people would rather sacrifice the gains made in the economy as a whole if it means they get to keep their job, others would rather keep the other benefits they get in exchange, and retrain or retool into new sectors. Some people cannot do that. 

Its a problem with no good solutions that benefit everyone.",1,1742569227.0,7,miz5jrn,1jgddmh
mizzdyk,AgitatorsAnonymous,"Frankly, manual labor jobs are limited time jobs without proper workplace safety practices, employee protections and without easy access to cheap healthcare (both phsyical and mental).

>And on the other hand, if the standard bell curve is to be believed, it is ultimately unsustainable to only have job opportunities for a smaller and smaller percentage of the populace.

Some people cannot do that. 

I agree with this. As automation continues and AI improves, UBI becomes pretty much mandatory. There will never be enough jobs for everyone and not everyone can do menial labor work, which is also shown to be bad for you. That is the reality.

Either AI and automation have to be legislatively curtailed to create jobs, or UBI is needed and high corporate and top 5% wealth bracket taxes become necessary to support that UBI.

Guenther, acting general counsel for the Department of Commerce.

>The Virginia lawmaker requested financial disclosures from Lutnick and his Deputy Secretary in addition to all political appointees, plus a copy of their electronic communications with the White House and correspondence between the White House Counsel, Office of Government Ethics, or Office of the Special Counsel and the Department of Commerce prior to his Fox interview.

>Connolly requested that Guenther present the information by April 3.

Americans can do what the world is doing — boycott anything connected to the oligarchs. And not just for a day but forever. Make lifestyle changes that don’t support capitalism, consumerism, materialism. The populace created this mess. We all have the power to stop it. That’s doing something. That’s activism. 

Start here:

https://www.boycottoligarchs.com

>The power of oligarchs grows directly with financial disparity and wealth. One person with $100 billion can be more powerful than 100 people with $1 billion each.

>Their wealth is primarily in the form of stocks. Even a 10-20% drop in revenue can cause their companies to go from hugely profitable to unprofitable, and it would crush their stock prices. Billionaires liquid assets come from taking loans against their stock holdings.

>The goal must be to not just reduce the power of oligarchs, but to prevent the ability to become one. Within capitalism, decision making power and profits are given to those who own stocks, land, and property. In a capitalistic system, money begets more money and power. 

>Instead of giving your money to billionaires, start buying from smaller businesses first. When there’s not a more ethical alternative, consider trying to start a worker co-op with some like-minded people, or crowdfunding others who want to do the same. Take power out of their hands, and put it into the hands of normal people. Create a parallel economy.

I’ve spent since inauguration restructuring my entire footprint and eliminating any of my money going into pockets of capitalists.

It's worth noting that in both cases there was a strong core of support, on principle, for social and lifestyle freedom, open borders (with caveats and self-sufficiency requirements) and other positions the 'libertarians' of today do NOT support at all. Anyway the lack of leadership after the 2012 Paul campaign ended led to the movement being co-opted by the worst Republicans of the era - Michelle Bachmann, Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, and so on.

The thing is many of us libertarian types were vehicles to create a Republican umbrella. The handful of us that were more Ron Paul types never fit in (I personally never voted R) so it was easy to expel us when momentum was the Republican side. Then add the whole populist movement that the Democratic Party chose to ignore and you really had a recipe for the current political landscape. So many of the Bernie and AOC types jumped that “we” were not welcome or needed. It is why you see people like Masse pushed off to the side.  

It has been evident that after the Democratic Party abandoned the southern/jim crow era way back in the early 70s it really lost its way. It is a road bump and will continue to be for sometime. 

I think sanders and AOC have the right idea to split the party and just let it crash and burn. At this point it looks like it won’t even matter anyways.

You can see it in the Wisconsin Supreme Court where the R is already screaming fraud and early voting just started. Guarantee that internal polling shows him losing or near dead heat.

miyrcl1,ConsistentStop5100,"“Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky has insisted that “all nuclear power plants belong to the people of Ukraine” after reports that his US counterpart Donald Trump said an American takeover of the country’s nuclear power would offer the “best protection” for it.
Mr Zelensky denied discussing with Mr Trump the possibility of US ownership of the Zaporizhzhia plant, but said they did discuss “how to find the solution from the situation and… take the station from the Russians.

Trump probably doesn’t know, as most people don’t, that Russia already tried this. During Biden’s presidency, Russia’s defense minister told the secretary of state that they have intelligence that Ukraine is planning a dirty bomb attack in Russia-occupied Ukraine. 

Biden responded by having inspectors sent to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities to confirm there was no evidence they were doing this, and then he contacted all of Russia’s closest allies to inform them that Putin was planning on using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, and arvised them to contact Putin and tell him there will be consequences if he does that.

The US is negotiating with Russia for Ukraine's surrender essentially. Hence the US's treatment of Z when he was in the Oval, as well as wanting to give the land Russia stole, to Russia. They are appalled that Z hasn't shown appreciation for (what...exactly?) leaving them out of peace talks? ceasefires? giving support based on conditions?  
It was the previous administration who assisted Ukraine and kept the country's promise consistent with the Budapest Memorandum that was violated by Russia.

Yesterday, Russia wanted everyone else to stop supporting Ukraine THEN Russia would stop attacking. (lol)  
Now the US, after not getting resources in exchange for assistance against Russia. They want to take over the Nuclear power plants as a show of support.

I'm glad Z is saying absolutely not, but lets say it did happen then what....if nobody thinks Trump and Putin will ""team up"" and hold those nuclear facilities hostage to some degree, they are naive. Trump would let Russia keep doing what they're doing as long as they leave the power plants alone, and if Ukraine continues to fight back, they could threaten Ukraine with turning off the power at any time.

Obviously Kamalia would have been better than trump. Obviously. But look at what's happening right now, even. Look at the policies Kamila actually put forward.

Personally, I think the Democrats could have a better strategy than “vote for us or you get Trump back”. Find another label for this strategy other than “coercive control”.",1,1742566289.0,5,miz2hmf,1jgd86o
mj0mzaq,Franc000,"Exactly this. It's the political processes.

Once the American people have won over the oligarchs and fascists, they will need to do a huge cleanup in their political elite and political system so that such a takeover can't ever happen again.

First thing in my opinion is getting rid of First Past the Post to something similar to the Nordic countries. 

With the current system you inevitably end up with 2 parties, which means that you inevitably end up having an adversarial relationship instead of a cooperative one with the other team, and it is super easy to capture those parties by oligarchs, corporations, and foreign influence. They just need to bribe/blackmail their preferred party enough to tip the balance from 49% to 50+1%.

So a system that is surviving and thriving right next to Russia as a bastion of democracy means it's a robust and good system. With such a system, instead of converging to 2 parties, you are diverging your parties into something representative of the population. If you have 3 to 5 parties, external influences will have a very hard time pushing the vote higher than 50%, as a coalition of the other parties could always beat the ""externally favored"" party.",1,1742581696.0,2,miy7d0f,1jgd86o
mizhgih,morpheousmarty,"Are you sure? What ideas are the establishment Democrats leaving on the table to battle Trump? Making a bunch of noise? We did that in the election and the Democratic base decided it wasn't good enough, even though some of the greatest living orators made the case, and the candidate was out there every day making the case, and the feedback was ""they aren't messaging"". Making noise isn't going to work, we've proved that twice over.

Right now the establishment is suing Trump from top to bottom. Literally the only thing they have the power to do except the few states that have Democratic governors and legislature to resist Trump, and even then they can't interfere with immigration, they can just stop cooperating which they have already been doing.

What this article and this top comment prove is that the base is waiting for some magical action they assume the establishment can make without a majority in any branch of government. 

We need to stop this, the democratic party is doing all it can, if we won't listen to Obama, Biden, Kamala, Bill, we're not likely to find anyone more persuasive.

More of them could be holding these town hall events to galvanise people and built support for protest. People need to be shown they won't be alone if they make sacrifices to stand up. People need leadership to turn out in large enough numbers to make protest effective.

In the election, skilled orators promising more of the status quo was never going to fucking sell anyone. People are desperate for change. The status quo sucks. Yes, fascism is worse, but just telling people it could be worse was never going to be an effective message. No one wants to die on the barricades for the incredibly shitty status quo, preaching about how great the objectively terrible status quo is was never going to and still won't inspire anyone.

mizjxom,DisMFer,"I think more than anything this is what is making the old guard Democrats so weak. They see Trump as a brief aberration. When the Neo-Cons were in power, they would work with them constantly. They were friends. Guys like Schumer would go golfing with guys like Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney. Sure occasionally they'd have to go on TV and call the Democrats a bunch of gay immigrant-loving pansies who hate America, but it was just a puppet show. These guys would laugh about it at dinner later that night. 

Schumer figures that if they just wait it out that the GOP will burn through the lunatics and they'll get back to being coworkers who can all focus on the real job of padding their stock portfolios and making their rich buddies a truck load of money. He and the Democrats like him don't realize just how far gone the average Republican voter is and in turn how far gone the Republican party is.

Then seemingly in a few weeks a lot of new people got hired and they're freaking nuts who get pissed off the second you say anything and constantly push insane conspiracy theories. A few of your older conservative coworkers quit and a few start acting the same way, not because they believe the nut jobs over you, but because they don't want to have to deal with the fight and rather just fit in. 

You keep expecting the nuts to get fired but instead all that is happening is that you're doing a worse job because you're constantly having to try and work around lunatics who yell at you whenever you send them an email.

But his wife, or whatever she was, a lady, she was real small, like a bird. Wrists like little branches. Anyway, my partner and I get called out there every weekend and one of us would pull her aside and say ‘C’mon, tonight’s the night. Press charges.’ And this wasn’t one of those “deep down he really loves me” set ups, we get a lot of those, but not this. This girl was scared. She wasn’t gonna cross him no way, no how. Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMTs, put him in the car, drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank, he sleeps it off, next morning out he goes, back home. One night, my partner is out sick and it’s just me. Then the call comes in and it’s the usual crap. Broke her nose in the shower kinda thing. So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go. Only that night, we’re driving into town, and this sideways asshole is in my backseat humming “Danny Boy.” Heh. And it just rubbed me wrong. So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere, and I kneel him down and I put my revolver in his mouth and I told him, “This is it. This is how it ends.” And he’s crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he’s gonna leave her alone, screaming as much as you can with a gun in your mouth. And I told him to be quiet and I needed to think about what I was gonna do here. And, of course, he got quiet. Goes still and real quiet, like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. And we just stood there for a while, me acting like I’m thinking things over and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants. After a few minutes, I took the gun out of his mouth and I say, ‘So help me if you ever touch her again and such and such and such and such and blah blah blah blah blah.’

Walter: Just a warning?

Mike: Hmph. Of course. Just trying to do the right thing. But two weeks later, he killed her. Of course. Caved her head in with the base of Waring blender.

Instead of forming his fascist movement around racial ideas, the group that needs to be expelled from Trump’s America are the so-called “deep state.” Neoliberal globalists and their liberal progressive sheep. And everyone is welcome to the party, regardless of race. Trumps brand of fascism relies on an ideologically-cohesive people, not an ethnostate. This is why it’s fairly easy for them to argue that it’s not about racism, even though there are clearly racist undertones to their actions. (And that’s because even though all races are welcome in Trumps neofascist America, the ideology which must be adhered to is, essentially, white Christian fundamentalism.)",14,1742547567.0,8,mixkk4c,1jg33e5

Right. So a false premise. Or more precisely, an unstrategic premise. You're evaluating these people on their own individual merits instead of their role within our party and broader politics.

Schumer's competitor will absolutely be a worse person and a worse senator than Schumer. But Schumer's position of leadership is an anchor that's dragging the Dem party down. He's an awful negotiator and has been an awful negotiator for decades. And he's our key negotiator and won't step down from that role. His primary go-to for negotiation is getting on his knees and servicing his opponent. If this were a normal job, he would've been fired for gross ineptitude, but he's allowed to just stay in indefinitely making sure we lose on every front, including elections.

As for Jeffries, you seem to be confused. I was talking about his *primary* challengers there. I'd still vote for him in a general if I had to. But he and his office don't return calls from constituents about key issues. And he's one of our main spokespeople, but he has the charisma of a used sponge left in dirty water overnight. He's a *liability* in that role.

Again, you're not looking at the wider role these people play beyond their seats. Their seats are absolutely important. But in Schumer's case, his wider impact is more important than his seat, and it's a straight negative as is.",1,1742565129.0,10,miz1goi,1jg6pgn

I am delighted by how much work those last four words are doing

Let me know when you know who his competitor is.  Good times.

In 1988, everyone was wisely explaining why they wouldn't vote Gore in the primaries, or Dukakis, or Jesse Jackson.  They wouldn't vote Jackson because he kept saying racism existed, they wouldn't vote Gore because he kept talking about this ""climate change"" fantasy, and they wouldn't vote Dukakis because Dukakis genuinely sucked and couldn't win an election if his own mother was the only voter.

And so we all had to explain to them why they shouldn't be protest voting for the name they'd never heard of.

Because that name was David Duke.

You need to know who these two men's opponents are before continuing.  I promise you, it's going to change your tune.

This is not where my post comes from and I hope you'll stop trying to teach me my own meaning soon

&nbsp;

> If he stays in, it's going to make things much harder for all Dems to win across the board.

Try to understand, won't you?

You're the owner of a fine china shop.  You sell plates and whatnot.  It's a very large store.  Department store sized.

There is a terrible child inside.  He is smashing many plates.  It's costing you a fortune.  It's very bad to have him inside the store.

For some reason, US voters choose who goes into your store next.  It will either be the child again, or a team of angry drunk Scottish soccer players, who have been told that you said terrible things about each of their mothers individually.

I understand that you're trying to explain that the child is terrible for your store, and since every US citizen is co-owner with you, I sympathize.  I don't want the child there either.

It's just that you don't seem to understand that the alternative is the drunk soccer team.  You seem to believe that there's the option to *just* remove the child, and that whoever replaces them will be good.

Please just go look up who the alternative is now.  No more random speculation.  ***Go look.***

> Also, if nobody else will do it I'll goddamn primary Jeffries next time it comes around. Because someone's got to. 

Yes, someone's doing it, thanks

* Pressuring Trump: Despite not having any power at all in Congress, Dems were able to pressure Trump just today to back off his complete closure of the Dept. of Edu, and they've been able to do similar with other agencies and DOGE's access.
* Lawsuits: Dems and their supporting organizations have levied 132 lawsuits to date against the Trump admin and DOGE and they've won nearly all of them at current levels (i.e. many are going to be appealed by the DOJ) which has returned 100s of thousands of workers, most funding, and kept many agencies from closing.",-8,1742539399.0,2,miww6o3,1jg6pgn

mizi9jp,mrnuts,"> I hope the Democrat's donors are paying attention. Backing the Centrist Democrats going forward will only get you loses.

They are paying attention, but that doesn't mean they will shift their support.  

The Democratic billionaire donor class don't actually support the centrists because that's what they think will give ""us"" (speaking of the left broadly) the better shot at winning, they support the old centrists because they support and want the Republican Lite economic policies that are failing the working class, they just disagree with MAGA Republicans on the ugliest parts of the social aspects of their platform.

On balance, most of them would rather have Trump in office than a truly progressive Democrat.  They may not like the destructive social aspects of MAGA, but just like the Trump-supporting oligarchs they really want those large tax cuts in spite of having more wealth than they, their kids and their grandkids could ever spend.

None of this is meant to discourage normal left-leaning people from supporting AOC, Bernie, et al.  On the contrary double down in your support.   Despite what the consultant class of the Democratic party often suggests, we can win without the billionaire donors based on grassroots organizing and small dollar donations and this sort of strategy is more likely to produce better outcomes for the majority of us who aren't billionaires.",1,1742569936.0,2,miylm1v,1jgef4m

We must declare martial law and take back the country!"" and you have a dictatorship overnight. This is how it happened in Rome, when the senators seized power from Caesar. This is how it happened in Revolutionary France, when the government tried to root out people who they deemed traitors to the revolution, and this caused Napoleon to have a perfect path to dictatorship. It happened in Egypt in 2013, when the military tried to overthrow the democratically elected Morsi, and ended up with a military dictatorship. It happened in Spain, where a failed coup of the elected government led to the civil war and eventual dictatorship of Franco. 

Fundamentally speaking, small internal takeovers never lead to good long results. Either the coup fails and Trump declares martial law, or the coup succeeds and we get outright civil war.

At this point MAGA and its politics of hate are attacking so many hills, including ones fundamental to our democracy and principles which republicans used to share in the fight for against foreign adversaries, that they all must no be defended.

Justin Eichorn IS the embodiment of the MAGA party that has now swallowed the GOP.

There is no compromise to be found with them.",1,1742569114.0,2,miz4j1h,1jghja0
mizxocz,-Gramsci-,"Being able to identify the hills worth dying on is key. And it isn’t rocket science either.

When 60+% of the population is with you on “XYZ” hill? You rally there.

Second, you need the talent as a communicator and message crafter to rally the public to that hill. That 60+%? You get all, or almost all, of them with you on that metaphorical hill. 

We need politicians who know how to do that. 

Lastly, I wanna make this point. 

This is not a “progressive vs. centrist” thing. That is not the right debate. 

A lot of these 60+% hills? They aren’t for some radical left concept. Either social or economic. 

They are for things like: 

“We do not want to lose our global power and be a vassal state of Russia.” 

“We want a government that is strong, competent, and willing to protect us and our global interests.”

“We want a government beholden to every day Americans. Not part time American trillionaires who play with our lives like we are their toys.”

Put more simply: “We dont want Elon Musk running our country like some perverted Marvel villain puppet master.”

All of these “hills” can have 60-70% popular support. 

What the Democratic Party needs in this fight for its soul right now… is not a “left vs. moderate” fight…

It’s a “you know how to identify the hill, you know how to rally the public to fight on that hill, and you know how to scrap and FIGHT on that hill… to never get pushed off that hill.” vs. “You can’t do that either because your too bad at politics to identify it, you too bad at communicating to rally people to it, or you’re too WEAK to scrap on it.”

The civil war in the party needs to be “strong vs. weak.” 

If you’re weak? We need you out. 

Out of Congress. Out of leadership positions. Out of the consulting firms we use. Out of every corner of the apparatus. 

Moderates? We can, and should, have them on hand. They’re great! They can win key districts! All I ask is that they know how to fight.",1,1742574433.0,3,mizfhvs,1jghja0

**CONTESTING THE VOTE: CHALLENGING A JUSTICE; Job of Thomas's Wife Raises Conflict-of-Interest Questions**


*The wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said today that she was working at a conservative research group gathering resumes for appointments in a possible Bush administration but that she saw no conflict between her job and her husband's deliberations on a case that could decide the presidency.*


*The comments from the justice's wife, Virginia Lamp Thomas, a former Republican Congressional aide, came as a federal judge in Nashville said Justice Thomas faced a serious conflict of interest as a result of his wife's work for the Heritage Foundation.*


*The foundation has close ties to the Republican Party and would probably have a say in the hiring of key government officials if Gov. George W. Bush assumed the presidency. In e-mail distributed on Capitol Hill earlier this month, Mrs. Thomas solicited resumes ''for transition purposes'' from the government oversight committees of Congress.*


*A decision by Justice Thomas to recuse himself could alter the outcome of the case now before the court, which is weighing whether to allow a manual recount of votes in Florida. On Saturday, by a vote of 5 to 4, the court blocked the recount for now. Justice Thomas, who was appointed to the court by President George Bush, Governor Bush's father, was in the majority.*


*If Justice Thomas were to recuse himself, it could result in a 4-to-4 tie in the case now before it, which would allow the ruling by the Florida Supreme Court to stand.*


*''There is no conflict here,'' Mrs. Thomas said in an interview. She insisted that she rarely discussed matters before the Supreme Court with her husband and that Justice Thomas therefore should not consider recusing himself from the landmark case.*


*A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore said he had no comment on accusations of a conflict of interest. ''The Vice President has the highest regard for the independent judiciary, so we're not going to comment on the various questions that have been raised,'' said Mark Fabiani, a Gore campaign spokesman.*


*Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush transition team, said he was aware that the Heritage Foundation regularly collected job resumes during presidential transitions, but he said he did not know if the organization was coordinating its efforts with the Bush camp.*


*Like many professional women, Mrs. Thomas should not be judged by her spouse,'' Mr. Fleischer said, denying any conflict of interest. ''She should be judged on her own merits and qualifications.''*


*He suggested that the accusations were the work of the Gore campaign.*


*A federal appellate judge, Gilbert S. Merritt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, said he saw a serious conflict of interest for Justice Thomas in deciding a case that could throw the election to Governor Bush.*


*''The spouse has obviously got a substantial interest that could be affected by the outcome,'' he said in an interview from his home in Nashville. ''You should disqualify yourself. I think he'd be subject to some kind of investigation in the Senate.''*


*Judge Merritt, who has long association with the Gore family and was considered a leading contender for the Supreme Court early in the Clinton Administration, said he would not launch a formal complaint against Justice Thomas.*


*But he urged Justice Thomas to remove himself from the case in order to prevent any violation of a federal law -- he cited Section 455 of Title 28 of the United States Code, ''Disqualification of Justices, Judges or Magistrates'' -- that requires court officers to excuse themselves if a spouse has ''an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.''*


*Judge Merritt offered his views about Justice Thomas after someone in the Gore campaign provided The New York Times with his name and telephone number. Judge Merritt said he had had no direct contact with the Gore campaign.*


*Kathy Arberg, a spokesman for the Supreme Court, said she had no comment on the accusations of a conflict of interest. The Court has also been unwilling to comment on a suggestion from Gore campaign aides that Justice Antonin Scalia should consider recusing himself because his son works for a firm that represents Mr. Bush.*


*The son, Eugene Scalia, is a partner in the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Another partner, Theodore B. Olson, argued Mr. Bush's case before the Supreme Court today.*


**Referring to her husband, one of the court's most conservative and taciturn members, Mrs. Thomas said, ''We don't talk about Supreme Court business. Clarence just isn't the kind. He protects me. We have our separate professional lives.''**


**On Dec. 4, Mrs. Thomas sent an e-mail message to members of the House and Senate committees on government oversight seeking resumes for the presidential transition. She directed would-be applicants to forward their resumes along with a history of political activities or references to an associate at the foundation.**


**Mrs. Thomas said tonight that her recruitment efforts were bipartisan and not on behalf of the Bush campaign.**


**''The Bush campaign would be as surprised as I was by any implication that I was working with them,'' she said.**


*Mrs. Thomas acknowledged, however, that her search was likely to generate more interest among Republicans, because of the foundation's conservative orientation.*

So what may end up happening is that Roberts tries to thread a line where they determine that acts that clearly violate the Constitution are not official acts because Trump is not acting in accordance with what the Constitution permits.  We can only hope.",1,1742566728.0,3,miyeyix,1jgedy7
mizyzmj,MommyLovesPot8toes,"I agree. I've always thought of him as a true ""conservative justice"". A Justice who belives wholly in the law but sees the law and his role in it as something that should not be used as a mechanism for progressive change. Meaning, he would say the Supreme Court shouldn't have had to decide on the repeal of Roe v Wade because Congress should have long ago acted to make a clear legislative decision on abortion. A court's interpretarion should not be the basis for what is and is not illegal on the whole, only for how the law is applied in specific situations. I can respect that feeling, even if my natural leaning in most situations would be different than his. 

The immunity ruling, though... That one upset everything I thought I knew about this country, about SCOTUS, about Roberts. I can only assume - if I want to give him the benefit of the doubt - that he believed the public would not elect someone who would abuse that immunity, and that even Trump wouldn't go so far as to abuse it. I don't think Roberts wants to live in a dictatorship. I don't think he wants to live in a theocracy. I think he's personally appalled at what is happening. But if he's done anything questionable - like take bribes - he may not have the balls to go against the wannabe dictator for fear of exposure.",1,1742574823.0,3,miyeyix,1jgedy7

The original revolution of America against the British was a planned group of like minded people. I have a strong feeling that the American people would rather keep things the same no matter how much worse it gets for them than even thinking of gathering together to either revolt or even a civil war to break out.

It's not like you can just hop on a train for cheap and take a few hours ride to Belgium from near any member state to protest EU leadership decisions. 

It's not like Paris where you have over 2 million alone who could pop in and out to keep presence up while others went back to tend wounds or maintain a home or job then come back out. It's a few hundred dollars to get out there then sleeping on the street or paying for a hotel for the duration of the protest.

And it's not like people aren't protesting and calling to voice their displeasure and showing up at political events pissed off and demanding answers.

At what point would you give up your job, house, healthcare, ability to feed your kids,  go into debt to travel hundreds of miles and sleep on the street or in a hotel you have to pay for.

Also, it emphasizes learning a few sets of skills really really well each year. It's organized in a way where most kids don't forget everything they learned the year before, and what they're learning each year reinforces what they learned previously.

This modern trend of omitting the word ""that"" is ruining our language. You shouldn’t omit a word if doing so changes the meaning of what you're attempting to communicate.

I get **that** that is a different context because it doesn't alter the meaning, but I'd encourage anyone to read The Canterbury Tales and do a write-up on all the ways we speak that have changed our ability to convey meaning and then speak in Middle English for awhile.

Yes, languages change. Yes, it sucks more the older you get.

George Mason - “I ask, sir, what is a militia? It is the whole people… to disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them.”

Thomas Jefferson - “What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.”

Alexander Hamilton- “if the representatives of the people betray their constituents, there is then no resource left but in the exertion of the original right of self-defence, which is paramount to all positive forms of government”

Hamilton, again, out of context[. Here's the whole context. ](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed28.asp)If anything, Federalist 28 lays out exactly why the 2nd amendment was about state militias serving as a check on federal power, not individuals.

And your last quote by Patrick Henry isn't even accurate. This part: ""the great object is that every man be armed.

mivmoha,T_Shurt,"As per [original article](https://people.com/trump-admin-publishes-ssns-living-people-unredacted-jfk-files-11700615) 📰:

- The newly unsealed files have not yet produced revelations about the assassination itself. 

Social Security numbers and other private information belonging to hundreds of Americans — some of whom are still living — were made public as President Donald Trump’s administration released more than 60,000 pages of unredacted documents pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Both The New York Times and the The Washington Post report that the personal information — including Social Security numbers of congressional staff members, intelligence researchers and others — was made public on Tuesday, March 18, along with their corresponding files on the 1963 assassination.

Former Trump campaign lawyer Joseph diGenova, whose information was apparently part of the release, told the Post that the move was “absolutely outrageous” as well as “sloppy” and “unprofessional.”

“It not only means identity theft, but I’ve had threats against me,” said diGenova. “In the past, I’ve had to report real threats against me to the FBI. There are dangerous nuts out there.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, per the Times, that the Trump administration is aware that it released personal information of former government employees and that the National Archives and the Social Security Administration “immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals whose personal information was released in the files.”

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Thursday, March 20.

The release of the documents on March 18 — 64,000 of the 80,000 total pages Trump had promised — came just one day after the president vowed to release all the remaining assassination files during a Monday visit to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

A person with knowledge of the documents’ release told the Times that officials knew releasing them without redactions would lead to the publishing of Americans’ personal information. Journalists and historians sifting through the document drop have so far failed to uncover any major new revelations about the assassination itself.

William Harnage, a former government contractor, told the Times that he considered the release of his information “almost criminal.” Harnage said he learned from a reporter that his Social Security number from a 1977 file had been made public.

According to the Post, among the information made public was the personal information of some former staffers of the Church Committee — a group that identified abuses by the CIA, FBI, Internal Revenue Service and multiple other agencies. Some of those people have since frozen their bank accounts and credit cards after being contacted by reporters this week.

“It just shows the danger of how this administration is handling these things with no thought of who gets damaged in the process,” a former staffer of the Church Committee told the newspaper.

“It seems like the damage is done, but clearly we have to talk to some lawyers,” the staffer added.

Judy K. Barga, a former government contractor who still supports Trump overall, told the Times that the release of her personal information was “not good for anybody.”

“People’s private information should be kept private,” she said.

As previously reported, the release of the files pertaining to the death of Kennedy — who was fatally shot during a Dallas motorcade in November 1963 — was teased during Trump’s first term, before former President Joe Biden took limited action by releasing some.

Trump has also ordered the release of files pertaining to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Jack Schlossberg — the only grandson of JFK — has repeatedly slammed Trump for pushing to declassify the remaining assassination files, which historians and insiders have long warned were unlikely to reveal anything surprising or validate conspiracy theories, given that the most substantial files were already public.

“The truth is [a lot] sadder than the myth — a tragedy that didn’t need to happen,” Schlossberg wrote in a Jan. 23 post to X, which he shared on Instagram later that day. “Not part of an inevitable grand scheme.”

He added, “Declassification is using JFK as a political prop, when he’s not here to punch back. There’s nothing heroic about it.”",203,1742510433.0,1,,1jg1ttm

Key takeaways:

* Ukrainian forces conducted a drone strike against Engels Airbase in Saratov Oblast on the night of March 19 to 20.
* Russia, Ukraine, and the United States have not yet concluded the details of the moratorium against energy infrastructure strikes. The Ukrainian strike against Engels Airbase would not have been subject to this moratorium in any event because it is a military target.
* The Kremlin announced that Russia and the United States will hold another round of talks in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia on March 24, and it is unclear whether these talks will include Ukraine.
* Kremlin officials continue to amplify narratives indicating that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains committed to his long-standing goals of conquering Ukraine and is attempting to leverage upcoming ceasefire negotiations to secure preemptive concessions from Ukraine and the United States.
* Kremlin officials are also working to exacerbate tension between the United States and its European allies in order to break Western support for Ukraine and undermine the NATO alliance.
* Putin continues to condition domestic Russian audiences to prepare for a protracted war in Ukraine rather than a sustainable peace built on compromise.
* The Kremlin is intensifying efforts to change the demographic makeup of occupied Ukraine in order to legitimize Putin's claim over occupied areas.
* The Kremlin also continues Russifying Ukrainian children in occupied areas to further the destruction of Ukrainian national and cultural identity and to portray Russia as the humane governor of occupied Ukraine.
* Kremlin officials continue advertising the possibility of future economic cooperation with the United States, likely to extract preemptive concessions from the United States in ceasefire or peace negotiations.
* Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump spoke about investments in Ukraine's energy infrastructure during their call on March 19.
* US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce condemned North Korea's involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine on March 19 and expressed concern about Russian support to North Korea.
* Ukraine’s allies continue to provide financial and material military assistance to Ukraine, including funds from frozen Russian assets in Europe.
* Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Belgorod Oblast and Russian forces recently advanced in Kursk Oblast and near Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and Velyka Novosilka
* Russia may extend military veteran status to Russian milbloggers and military correspondents covering the war in Ukraine, likely in an effort to further coopt and appease the Russian ultranationalist milblogger community.",51,1742542107.0,1,,1jg8a5a

Ground robotic complexes, heavily used by Ukraine’s Third Assault Brigade, are saving soldiers’ lives by handling dangerous logistics tasks, Deputy Commander Maksym Zhorin said on Radio NV on March 20.

""The experience of the Third Assault Brigade shows that, as of today, the GRCs (ground robotic systems - ed.) are a bit of an underrated story,"" he said.

“And today, 60% of the GRCs used in the army are used by the Third Assault Brigade.”

The brigade deploys these robots primarily to protect troops by taking over logistics and evacuation duties in high-risk zones. 

“Where it’s most dangerous today, like getting to and from positions, is riskier than staying put,” Zhorin added.

“It’s safer for an infantryman on the line than making that trip once either way. We’re shifting this to drones and platforms, and GRCs will be part of the unmanned units in the new corps.”

At a European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday, March 20, EU leaders failed to reach an agreement on allocating €5 billion for the purchase of 2 million artillery shells for Ukraine this year. According to Bloomberg, several countries – including France and Italy – refused to commit to specific financial contributions.

France and Italy believe the initiative is still insufficiently developed and are requesting more technical and financial details.

French diplomats stated that while they support the goals of the initiative, their priority is the EU’s €18 billion contribution to the G7 loan package for Ukraine.

According to Bloomberg, France and Italy – the EU’s two largest economies after Germany – are reluctant to publicly disclose how much they are willing to provide, especially when large sums are involved.

Earlier this year, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, proposed that EU countries provide up to €40 billion in military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The aid would be voluntary – either in cash or equipment. However, after several countries raised objections, this week’s discussions were narrowed to focus solely on the ammunition component.

Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo advocated for the initiative and complained about the resistance it faced from some EU capitals. Many countries are not “performing adequately” when it comes to arms deliveries to Ukraine, he said.

At the same time, others criticized the approach of setting contribution figures too early, before securing the countries’ agreement to participate.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said setting numbers first “was done backwards.”

“It may create an impression that someone doesn’t do enough – but readiness to support Ukraine is there, even if it is difficult to quantify it now,” Nausėda told reporters.

Linked by video to the summit in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on EU leaders to urgently provide €5 billion for artillery shells for Ukraine. Kaja Kallas had previously put forward a similar initiative.

Zelensky made an urgent plea for the sum to purchase ammunition “as soon as possible,” making reference to a massive overnight drone strike over Ukraine as the war drags on.

“It’s crucial that your support for Ukraine doesn’t decrease but instead continues and grows,” Zelensky said. “And this is especially true for air defense, military aid, and our overall resilience.”",29,1742558043.0,1,,1jg8a5a

It isnt that important to put a number to his personal wealth when he is a dictator since the price for anything within the borders of Russia is effectively 0 for him.

If he wants something from outside Russia he can just confiscate enough resources from the state, the state own companies or some oligarch he dislikes to purchase it. 

The more wealth there are in Russia the richer he is even if his savings account would show 0. 

In a democracy being a politician isnt equalled to wealth. You can use the position to become more wealthy. Being wealthy also gives you a certain amount of power and influence. But it is far from a 1:1 conversion. Like Musk is wealthy and have a lot of power but even though he is wealthy as fuck he still have less power in many regards than a lot of politicians. 

But when you are the authoritatian ruler of a nation your wealth is directly linked to your political power. As long as Putin stays in control he is effectively one of the richest men in the world.

mizotem,DocMoochal,"IMO its largely due to globalization. World war one started during a period of entrenched globalization but maybe not to the scale that we have in the modern era.

A global war would collapse the global economy. A lot of wealthy people would have their fortunes ruined, not all of them but a lot of them. It would ruin most working peoples retirements, lives and probably lead to decades of work for financial institutions. And the poor would be better off diamond swording themselves.

We'd quickly revert to a pre ubiquitous computing era as infrastructure is attacked and systems become unreliable which would lead to a mass reversion in just about every aspect of our lives.

Excluding all the big stuff, just think about oil for a sec. It wasnt until about the 40's and 50's that oil really became a nessecary commodity for society globally, and even then most people still knew how to exist without it.

mj0s9rl,beachedwhale1945,"> when in 30 years I haven't heard of any outages like this before? 

I can guarantee you multiple UK substations have gone down in the last 30 years. I found a couple annual reports on the UK electrical grid that mention dozens of annual Loss of Supply incidents, many involving substations (though as yet no substation fire). You never heard about them because most were cleared quickly (including an alternate supply taking the load) or did not affect such internationally recognized infrastructure.

> I never said sabotage was definitely the case but if you really don't think it's a serious possibility then the issue isn't with me seeing what I want to see, it's with you burying your head in the sand.

Sabotage should be considered as a possibility, as should a dozen others until they can be ruled out. But that doesn’t mean we jump to the conclusion that sabotage was the most probable cause, especially when we have very limited evidence.

I will offer only one argument against sabotage right now: this is not a good time to hit Heathrow. If I’m Russia intelligence and I’ve identified a way to easily disable one of the most important airports in Western Europe, I hold onto that card. Hitting Heathrow at that vulnerable point will force the British to fix the problem and make the system more robust, which will almost certainly make that target harder to hit in the future. I’d save that for a more critical moment, one where taking out Heathrow would cause the maximum impact, such as the start of or during a conventional war when airliners with troops will likely use Heathrow to get to the front lines more quickly. But more than that, you’ve revealed you can identify particularly vulnerable grid infrastructure in the UK and have the means to disable it, so these will be reinforced nationwide. If war ever came, the ability to collapse the British electrical grid, in whole or part, would be a very powerful card Russia would absolutely want to play at an opportune moment, but with a reinforced grid that becomes far more difficult to accomplish.",1,1742583252.0,4,mizxdhf,1jgh8aj

He has also announced an unprecedented inspection and digitisation of the vaccination records of all children in Poland.

>The developments come after an unvaccinated child was admitted to hospital in Wrocław this month with diptheria, a disease that it is obligatory in Poland to vaccinate against. Recent years have, however, seen a rapid growth in the number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children.

>This is “the first case of severe diphtheria in an unvaccinated child in many years in Poland”, said Grzesiowski at a press conference on Tuesday. He noted that the six-year-old child had developed the illness after returning from Africa.

>Diphtheria can often be fatal in young children. The infected child in Wrocław remains in serious condition, with Grzesiowski revealing that he has been placed into an induced coma. An adult who had close contact with the child has also been hospitalised with a milder case of the disease.

>

>In an interview with broadcaster TVN on Thursday, Grzesiowski argued that action needs to be taken to ensure that parents comply with the requirement to give their children mandatory vaccinations.

>He noted that currently, although parents can in theory be fined for failing to do so, the legal process can “last several years and it does not work”. Parents are able to “not vaccinate their child and not have any major problems because of it”.

>To improve the situation, “we would have to change the entire system, rebuilding it in such a way that an unvaccinated child would have to have difficult access to various elements of social life, such as preschool or school or any other where a large group could be infected”, said Grzesiowski.

>

>But he admitted that this would be difficult “because in the Polish legal system everyone has the right to use preschool or school – this is guaranteed by the constitution – so there are no simple solutions here”.

>Article 70 of Poland’s constitution states that: “Everyone shall have the right to education. Education to 18 years of age shall be compulsory.” Some lawmakers have previously proposed banning unvaccinated children from nurseries and preschools, a measure already implemented by a handful of local authorities.

>Speaking to TVN, Grzesiowski said that any such measures would not be about depriving children of education but of deciding how that education takes place. “Can a child take part in group glasses or will they have to have an individual course of care or education,” he said.",1,1742573124.0,1,,1jggezl
miztova,BubsyFanboy,">However, Grzesiowski emphasised that above all it is crucial that parents receive reliable information in order to disabuse them of the idea that vaccines harm, rather than help, children.

>Poland, like other countries, has seen a rapid rise in the number of parents refusing compulsory vaccinations for their children. The number of such cases rose from 3,437 in 2010 to 87,344 – a more than 25-fold increase.

>As a result, the number of children being vaccinated against some diseases, such as measles, has fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity. In 2017, the level had dropped to 93% and is now even lower. Last year, Poland saw a surge in measles infections.

>

>In a separate interview on Thursday with broadcaster Radio Zet, Grzesiowski also revealed that his organisation, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate (GIS), will in the coming weeks launch its first-ever inspection of the vaccination records of all children in Poland.

>Inspectors will manually check around 7.5 million records. “This system is still based on paper documents, so the inspector must go to the vaccination point and check by looking at each vaccination card,” explained Grzesiowski.

>As part of the inspection, the data will be transferred to an electronic system, making it easier in the future to check who has been vaccinated and against which diseases.

>Those plans drew criticism from the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) party, which has long opposed many forms of compulsory vaccination.

Under this scenario, it would challenge the willingness of NATO to engage in an offensive military action to liberate the Baltics against Russia, especially considering the risks of escalation and nuclear war. For instance, I doubt the Americans that elected Trump would be willing to go to war against Russia when the fighting is already over. 

Another risk would be for Russia to support separatist Russian insurgencies in the Baltic, similarly to what was done in the Donbass, which would also challenge the willingness of NATO to get involved in such a scenario. The separatists could be shown as freedom fighters by a disinformation campaign. The fighting could seem too small scale and too local and thus could be considered a local problem and not one for the entire alliance. And the lack of direct Russian involvement might also support this idea that this is solely a local issue. Under such a scenario, Russia could take over the Baltics with little resistance from NATO.

mizz3cn,Musiclover4200,">  and anyone suggesting that a human and resource depleted Russia has any capability to invade NATO members is delusional.

Some things worth considering:

1: If they succeed in taking Ukraine they will 100% conscript anyone they can, I'm sure it's already happening in occupied areas on top of using prisoners and other war crimes

2: Sanctions did a number on their war chest, if/when trump undoes sanctions that will give them a lot more access to resources to enable future conflicts

3: No one wants nuclear war, russia has slowly been testing the waters to see what they can get away with before triggering a conflict with NATO. If emboldened enough or after installing enough puppets in NATO countries they absolutely would risk it especially if they get support from trump/US

4: Putin is delusional as well, a common issue with dictatorships is they get surrounded by yes men who will tell them up is down if it means getting to pilfer more. Who knows what crazy BS his advisors are feeding him, as big a toll as this conflict has taken on them putin still might be crazy enough to try for more. 

5: Russia has gone all in on a wartime economy, if they succeed in Ukraine they will 100% move on to other countries it's just a question of who they target first. They're probably smart enough to save NATO members for last  but it also depends on how much support they get from trump

6: Trump is literally threatening to annex Canada/Panama/Greenland/etc, china seems set on taking Taiwan, there's a lot of looming conflicts that will distract the world.

> For 150 years Australia relied on the British Empire for its external defence. But Britain’s military and strategic focus on Europe in the early 20th century caused many Australians to worry about a Japanese invasion of our resource-rich continent. In the 1920s Britain, with support from Australia, formulated its Singapore Strategy whereby it would build a huge naval base on the island as a means of protecting its interests in the region. The fall of Singapore in 1942 led the Australian Government to reconsider its alliance with Britain.

This really is some fucking chutzpah. 

So, we get to gift the US $3 billion for their shipbuilding facilities.

And $368 billion overall for subs that the President (as the contract states) can just decide not to hand over when the time comes, since America has a current domestic deficit of 27 in their fleet and only a 1 or 2 per year sub manufacturing capacity.

And then, any eventuating subs may not be controlled or crewed by Australians at all,  so we will just pay though the nose to become a glorified forward operating base of an America with Imperial designs (Canada, Greenland, Panama)


Obviously Trump thinks that we can just take the expected position of an obedient little vassal-State.

Where I live (Spain) a ton of people with money is comming, and they can pay A LOT (up to half of what I make in a year just for two weeks. Owners have turned them into vacation houses and you have to pay up to 300€ daily)

Owners and hedgefunds from outside are making a lot of money with that, but they are fucking the rest of us and we literally can't afford renting a flat.

Rent was 500€ just 6 years ago, now it's up to 1200€ (Small town of 80k) plus water, gas, electricity...etc. for a 2 bedroom flat.

I make 1.3k a month, the math is easy.

It's getting out of control. Business are having a hard time finding workers because workers cannot afford to work, living is more expensive than that you make working in some places (money is not going to business, only to housing, so the wages are not inflated).

Inflated housing destroys everything. You can earn lower salaries, but you need to have cheaper housing. With how expensive cars are now, and how expensive the housing is getting (400k for a 2 bedroom flat that get instantly sold to rich people or corporations), shit is going to explode eventually.",73,1742511027.0,4,miuky3r,1jfw4mi

* Scientists are a relatively very small fraction of the population.  You'd need to bring *a lot*, like *really a lot* of them to have any noticeable effect on the housing market.  So, that's not an issue really.

* By and large, most immigrants or refugees don't compete with local Dutch population for the same properties because of the price difference. I.e. building more houses within 350K+ Euro range will not have any noticeable effect on the refugee housing problem (they simply cannot afford this kind of housing), while local Dutch population will not be thrilled to live in anything below 350k Euro.  The boundary, of course, depends on the specific region of the Netherlands, but the general idea applies regardless.

So, if local Dutch population experiences a housing crisis, it's probably not because of the refugees or North African worker migrants simply because they don't compete for the same properties.",41,1742501186.0,4,miufxma,1jfw4mi

The Kremlin is basically comparable to an alien race: They understand that humans communicate through language, but it is not the Kremlin's native form of communication. They have learned that if they make the right audible sounds, they can gain an advantage. They have elevated the study of deception to a science, but they do not value spoken language for any other purpose.

The Kremlin's native language is violence. Violence is something that they use and understand. The ""guy falling out of windows"" and ""polonium tea"" incidents aren't simply revenge; that's how the Kremlin _speaks_. It is their form of communication.

_NOTHING_ Russia _says_ has any meaning except as indicator who and how they want to deceive. The only thing that we should pay attention to is what they _do_.

And that is very very difficult to accept by Western media, politicians, and diplomats, because their primary tool is language. And language as a tool is simply useless when dealing with Russia.

This particular passage plan took them through an anchorage. They'd taken the same route every other sailing, and didn't deviate from their course for 100 miles. There were no course corrections leading up to the collision.

The anchored vessel would be swinging around it's chain with wind and tide, which can be up to 300m of anchor chain in my own experience of anchoring large vessels.

The most likely scenario is that nobody was keeping a lookout. Otherwise it was some tremendous preplanning, to aim for that particular vessel off the coast of Hull, with the last course correction being as they passed Newcastle.

Aside from the obvious safety aspect, there's a very good reason movies use uncontained gasoline for explosions and it's that actual high order explosions look really unimpressive.  Go compare actual footage of a hand grenade going off versus pretty much any movie you've ever seen.  Or go look carefully at the Mythbusters cement truck.  It simply stops existing and goes everywhere, but it's nowhere near the fireball that a fuel vapor explosion gives.

The Mythbusters one was even more illustrative because they used TNT which is low-order explosive, and is comparatively slow moving more for pushing things apart.

You're not wrong. I just hesitate to draw direct comparisons between Israel's previous governments and Hamas. While I have what I consider a stronger grasp than most Americans on the history of the conflict, I can't fairly claim to have a strong enough grasp on past governments to make any such comparisons.

>The reality is the Israeli government left Gaza to encourage peace, but still retained essential security because the PA could barely govern their own territory and to no surprise they lost control of Gaza to Hamas.

I think, if the territory belonged to the Palestinians, the Palestinian's ability to govern wasn't Israel's fucking business. Not until Palestinians started up hostilities again, anyway. But Israel threw away the moral high ground from the start, on this.

>But your line of thinking is equal to assuming (the PA secretly let Hamas take over Gaza) even though in reality it was infighting. Also further indicating that Palestinians can’t govern themselves.

This, though, is not something I'm saying. I don't think Israel conspired to bring Hamas to power.

That's like expecting France to cede Alsace-Lorraine to Germany today. Countries that attacked Israel forfeited the rights to those borders by doing so.

The position of Israel, which was also accepted by the current leadership of PA (but not Gaza) is that there should not be any unilateral recognitions of Palestinian independence (only in agreement with Israel) if they want to further the separation process.  This is so because Israel performs (however poorly) some duties on behalf of PA, and recognizing the ""independence"" of PA will ""nationalize"" those services provided by Israel to them. In a sense, this isn't that different from, say, Norway declaring that it recognized Germany's right to Alsace-Lorraine, or claiming that that region is a country of its own without even talking to France about it.",11,1742547424.0,4,mivzyui,1jfuaut

Again, I'm not saying the recognition of palestine isn't pointless, I'm trying to explain the rationale.

That's delusional.  No. This doesn't in any way encourage negotiations.  To Israel it signals ""we don't care about what you think at all"". And to Palestinians it signals ""we are lunatics because we neither support your current government, nor do we support any sensible alternatives"".

It just shows that whoever made that claim doesn't understand the situation they are dealing with.

However, recognizing Palestinian statehood at this juncture is irresponsible.

Palestinian populations have actively discussed this strategy...including the use of ""one sided"" agreements to accomplish incremental gain.  

Further, recognizing Palestinian statehood at a time which lies in the wake of one of the worst terrorist attacks in the history of mankind...can very well create conditions where peace is impossible due to the moral hazard of allowing the Palestinians to gain diplomatic status at such a time and perversely make peace impossible by making violence seem profitable.

miygorx,Credibull,Honest question here. The MMR vaccine used in the US has been the same since 1968. Pretty much any American under 57 has received at least one MMR injection.  Why do they fear something so widely used that likely protects them?  Does this same fear apply to DTaP or polio?,240,1742556898.0,5,miycwup,1jgdead
miym5s2,windraver,"I have family who are anti vax because they claim their kid was harmed.

I was a new father at the time and so I began to research why my relatives would suggest their kid was harmed. MMR vaccine usually occurs near a developmental leap for a baby. 

For those who have had kids for awhile, you'll know those developments as a storm week, which like puberty, is a growth in the kid's brain where say for example, they finally see you, or they finally realize they have hands, or the world is finally upright. It makes kids appearingly regress because their world made sense up until ""they suddenly realize object permanence"" or some other brain development.

Coincidentally, the MMR is applied right around that brain development leap so incorrectly, many people associated the vaccine to the regressions cause by the brain development. The kid isn't actually regressing. They're freaking out because ""what are these hands I just discovered lol"" or they're growing all their teeth which makes them crazy too.

In short, correlation is not causation but people want something to blame.

Edit:

- MMR vaccine is applied at 12 months
- 12 months is also average for the developmental leap:

miwgz7l,Cosmic-Engine,"No, this is actually something he very much *can* do.  He’s still complying with the legislation - the Congressional appropriations & requirements to assist disabled students &c - he’s just offloading those programs to other agencies.  There isn’t really a requirement that the Department must exist in any really specific form, just a number of programs that were administered by that agency.  And his EO specifically takes the approach of basically scooping out everything that the law requires, and leaving the Department a nearly completely hollowed-out shell.

This is something the right-wingers have been *praying* for - *LITERALLY* - for generations.  They won’t fuck it up by sending him an EO that could be defeated in court.  And while I’m not a constitutional lawyer, my reading of it is that it’s all very legal.

Which fucking sucks, I mean if you ask me the *primary* cause of most of our current problems is that we have undervalued, underfunded, and failed to set (much less achieve) the educational goals necessary to have the kind of populace - an informed one - which wouldn’t, ya know, elect a tyrant and then cheer as he destroys *everything*.  Now we’re going to rapidly see a departure from the profession of the most talented and most necessary people, alongside the death of a federalized, public school system.  We can still *kind of* expect that a person with a diploma from an Alabama high school knows as much as someone with a diploma from a Connecticut school.

I’m pretty sure that’s going to be proven to be *wildly* untrue in the span of five years or less.  Especially for poor kids, especially for nonwhite kids, especially *especially* for like, homeschooled and religious schooled children.  We’re going to start to see lots of children graduating high school believing that Democrats are evil, just factually.  That Black people are “naturally shiftless & brutish.”  That Hitler had some points, if you think about it.

It’s going to get *dark*, and at least in this case, there is very little that can be done to stop it.  There will be legal fillings but at most, they’ll be delaying tactics.  My hope is that they delay *enough* to get us to the midterms, the midterms actually happen, the process and results are fair & not tampered with, the Democrats win on a platform of saving public education, and win enough of a mandate that they’re able to pass legislation which saves (and even improves!) it.

mj0ph51,BurnoutEyes,"> For example, who is ripping a streaming TV show and then sharing it on torrent sites

There's actually a tiering system for release groups, and they do it for cred, not money. 

The release group sources the material as early as they can, sometimes before VFX are finished(The Wolverine is a good example). 

They then either create subtitles, or if there's already subtitles available they move on to re-encoding the file as fast as possible. 

After the file is encoded, they race to be the first to upload the copy to a Tier 1 ""Top site"", an FTP/SFTP server setup by the release groups. 

There are many ""topsites"", and you only gain access to the best ones by being fast.

These topsites are where the torrent sites will grab a copy from. They might be re-encoded again(like aXXo re-encoding Diamond rips) to decrease filesize or remove watermarks, and then they're uploaded to the Tier 2 torrent site.

These races happen quickly, with victories being measured in seconds at times.

Human labor shouldn't be a commodity. Labor is special in a way that can't be described in simple equations.

Whether or not Marx's equations are empirically correct is irrelevant because he pointed out the truth that production would be impossible without some form of labor and that in order to have a consumer base to actually sell products to and have a good society laborers need to earn money to buy things. 

In order to have a free society the laborers must be free to acquire things they want and need and they cannot do that if they are not paid enough and the economy crashes.

[After shooting and wounding his grandmother at their home, Ramos drove to Robb Elementary School, where he entered a classroom and shot his victims, having bypassed local and state officers who had been in the hallways.

Jason grew up in a seemingly perfect upper-middle class family in Littleton, Col., but he struggled to gain his father’s approval. When Jason failed to make the baseball team his freshman year, Jason and his father were devastated. Jason began rollerblading and excelled, but he quit because his father disapproved of the sport. Jason turned to drugs and by his senior year he was an addict. A year later, the Columbine High School shooters named Jason one of the bullies they retaliated against. Overcome with guilt and grief for his dead classmates, Jason’s addiction escalated. Now Jason lives on the streets of Denver, and his family is in pieces.",1,1742574700.0,5,mix3ngv,1jg1iub

During the Civil War, the military became the primary form of law enforcement in the South, but **during Reconstruction, many local sheriffs functioned in a way analogous to the earlier slave patrols, enforcing segregation and the disenfranchisement of freed slaves.**” (emphasis mine)

Only it is their choice to suffer at all. It's the great American Recreation Activity, finding something to be pissed off about.

Then you look at the media they consume and you see why. All the people that win every day they see got pissed off at something, mad enough to get and use a gun, and get what they want and need. They are led to believe that might makes right. The same people that in the majority think they can take on a lion hand to hand if they really needed to. But don't dare put on them a sense of responsibility. You say anything that makes them think THEY personally have to do something they will turn against you in a second. They want someone to go out there and make people as miserable as they are, and they think they have it so bad.

I heard benefactors of a public community pool in my town talking about how bad they had it. They were basking in the sun at a public pool with dozens of kids running around having a great time. They literally said that they had it as bad as the Jews in Poland and Germany. What you see is what they want. They don't want to have to do anything, but they will vote for someone that will say they will take from others and give to them.

The Campaign Message was so fundamentally wrong in the US. If you look at it like a word cloud you would see Democrats said ""we"" and ""us"" all the time while, Trump ran in ""I"" and ""you"". By and large Americans said they do not want to be wrapped up in having to do anything, even if it is for good. Trump said he would do bad to the bad people, and admitted good people would be caught up on it. That is good to them. Trump said he would do the dirty work and that is what they want. Democrats said ""we"" will make things better. That is enough presumptuousness to them that they will vote against them. It's presumptuous that people want to be part of activism. Trump's people only want to vote, and barely that.

It's bad here. The people swear we are on the brink of catastrophe but it is only because we keep pinching closer to the edge.

That way if someone comes at you with an accusation like, ""You only have <number>% employees of color, we think you should have more!"" you can trot out statistics to have a conversation like:

> ""We'd love to, but only <small number>% of our applicants are people of color and we actually have hired <large number>% of those. Further, we subject each candidate to a rigorous set of criteria so if you care to dive into our data you'll find that for cases where we did reject an applicant of color they were clearly not as qualified as the person we did hire."" 

It ""fixes"" affirmative action by making it so if the employee demographics are lopsided but you can prove your *applicants* were lopsided, then the solution for ""diversity"" should be to ask why people aren't applying. (Which COULD be internal and a different issue, but it at least shows your hiring process isn't the problem.) 

I feel like a lot of companies (and lawmakers) instead prop it up as ""Well let's have educational resources that tell people they can't discriminate"" and while businesses SHOULD do that it's not a new or novel idea.

When the two collide, the sheet converts the helix into a sheet. Sheets then go on to convert other helixes into sheets until your brain is full of proteins that it needs but can't use. 

The process can take decades and it's not easy to detect until it's far too late. Not like there's much we can do anyway, we can't refold a proteins back into the higher energy helix form with any modern medicine.

mizcpag,Gravelayer,"Atlanta metropolitan city  I misspoke  for clarification I'm not just including trains in talking about transportation in general.  In Atlanta I do not have to be shoved in a train with 50 plus people, Its not a hotbox for my entire transit trip, we do no have to worry about the platform being unlevel for about a foot so it's moree acceptable than the London cars , cleanliness was about the same in comparison to my trip, I did not take the busses so I can't comment on that , the traffic is also just as much as a shit show in Atlanta. The airlines at Heathrow was 10 x worse than Atlanta or any us airport I have been to..... Most of the staff were unable to communicate when the internal team opened or could give simple directions, security took 3x  as long. The gate wasnt listed until 15 minutes till my flight causing me and a number of passengers to have to scurry to get to the plane....it's just a terrible experience in comparison to the rest of Europe and arguably in similar American cities which is just surprising and yet again I'm sorry my British friends have to deal with that rat nest they call their transportation system.",-5,1742568290.0,6,miz9xo6,1jg7dby

I grew and now live back in Texas and every single metro area here is such a shit show when it comes to transit and urban planning… or anything I guess. We seem to be competing with Florida in our race for the craziest state. 

I lived in Chicago and exclusive used the transit system and there were definitely time I was crammed on the train. Chicago’s system is pretty good, but the freakin cubs games. Ugh!!! 

The times I’ve flown into/ through Heathrow I haven’t had issues, but I honestly don’t remember how the gate assignments work(it didn’t stick out to me) and it’s been several years since I’ve been there.

miyydm6,SolitaireJack,"That's not how electric works. You can't just have a cable as long as you like so you can place the generator anywhere, the longer it is the more ineffective the power it can supply becomes which, when you think about it, if fairly important when the gennie in question is having to power an **airport,** it needs every bit of juice it can get. There's also the matter of security. If the generator is there to supply power in case there is an equipment failure at the substation such as one of the transformers developed a fault, it has to be held within the substation grounds to keep it secure. Otherwise it would be stolen within hours. Rates of generator theft is insane and no amount of chains or locks will stop determined thieves.

There is a reason why people are crying foul, the amount of failsafe's and safety features built into substations makes genuine fires very rare. I worked in the industry for years. The amount of planning and design that goes into these systems is genuinely insane and completely underappreciated by the wider public.

miz4wbm,SolitaireJack,"Not so. Generators have to be mobile by their nature so won't be any bigger than can be fit on the back of a big rig. Criminals have access to this kind of equipment so will pull up, cut or solder through whatever it holding it in place then drive away with it. 

There was a power cut once where power was off to a half a village, power was restored by a 400KW generator. Criminals didn't give a shit, they ripped down the temporary fences that had been put up around it, cut the chains, disconnected the cables, hooked it up and drove off with it. Boom, half the village of elderly and vulnerable people without power again. 

And in the off chance they can't drive off with it for whatever reason, then they cannibalise it. Generators have a lot of sellable parts, fuel, precious metals, valuable parts, etc. They'll just cut it up like they're at a scrap yard.

mipwv0j,MacchuWA,"It's both! Yes, dogma, but also, don't forget, lots of people bought lots of Teslas, and they were promised full self driving. At the moment, there's the convenient fiction that it's still being worked on, but it's coming, it's just a software update away.

Accepting that Lidar will be required means recalling and hardware updates for those cars or an admission that no, full self driving is never coming, and I sold you on a lie, which would be grounds for a class action, or just directly at least a partial refund in many countries.

Note also that tonnes of Tesla's value, falling though it is, comes from them being valued as a tech company, with zero marginal cost of production on software. Admitting a software failure of this magnitude would further tank the price when people realise ""Holy shit, they're a car company!

But yea, it’s just perspective and dogma. Hardware solving a problem that software can (theoretically) do isn’t necessarily a bad or hacked solution.

miqu6de,OlderThanMyParents,"> Never said he was a good anything!

At the risk of appearing to defend someone I detest with ever fiber of my being, he does have a very important skill: the skill to hire good people.

Identifying a good job candidate, and getting that person to come to work for you, are very difficult skills, and a lot of really talented people just can't seem to do it. For whatever reason, he is able to hire very good people and convince them to work for his ""vision."" And what makes it even more interesting is that a really talented rocket engineer, or AI computer scientist, or car designer, is going to understand perfectly well that this guy doesn't know nearly as much as he thinks he does, and much of what he does know is oversimplifed or not germane to the problem at hand (remember that idiotic comment about the government databases being fraudulent because they're not deduplicated?) Yet, somehow Space X, and Tesla, and Starlink, are being very successful in spite of the clown who is at the head of the org chart, and who appears to spend less time at any of these jobs than he does fucking around on X taking potshots at public figures who displease him, and generally working as hard as he can to tank Tesla's stock value. (Of course, the reason they ARE successful is that he appears to have very little operational control.)",9,1742444794.0,6,miqnjp9,1jfb1zs

mipxwit,ThePlanck,"It kinds of reminds me of Enzo Ferrari, when primarily the British F1 teams of the time started winning after they put the engine at the back of the car he resisted because he believed that ""the horse should pull the car, not push it"". He was similarly slow to adapt to a lot of other changes the British teams (primarily Lotus) were experimenting with for mainly ideological reasons.

The differences are that 

1) Ferrari did eventually move the engine to the back of the car when the results became unreliable

2) The engines that he was so proud of were actually go and they were the reason that the british teams had to find other ways to beat his cars

3) Old man Ferrari was smart enough to realize that he should probably stick to cars and not try to mess with rockets, and tunnels and trying to invent new modes of transport that any respectable engineer will tell you immediately are not feasible, and torturing animals with brain chips, and being the worlds best gamer, and trying to run the US government",139,1742432413.0,4,miprazy,1jfb1zs

mirb2h4,ThePlanck,"Ferrari was bad with regards to safety, but in no way unique at the time, in fact I think other teams were often worse as they were trying to overcome the handicap they had to Ferrari's engines by improving the handling of the cars, often by making certain components lighter by either using less material, making them more likely to break, or just lighter materials, such as using Magnesium for the body (which the result that any high school chemistry student would be able to tell you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_RA302), and Stirling Moss had this quote: ""I can't think of a single occasion where a (Ferrari) driver's life was taken because of mechanical failure.""

One thing that can be said about Enzo Ferrari is that unlike the other team principals he was very business-like with his dealings with drivers and didn't show much emotion after the passing of his drivers (other than Gilles Villeneuve) though this seems to be more of a defence mechanism from being in the business so long and losing close friends in the early days of the sport.",28,1742454421.0,6,miqyg5n,1jfb1zs

mis1366,Gutternips,"I drove a Ferrari a fair bit back in the 80's (not mine, a friend's).  The gearbox was very quirky, it would bottom out on the slightest bump in the road, the heating was pretty useless in winter and there were some very quirky cockpit design choices such as the handbrake.

In the end though it didn't matter because it was fast and the car looked amazing and I think that was 99% of the reason why people bought them.",12,1742470160.0,7,mir3bb2,1jfb1zs

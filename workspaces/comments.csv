This group also was about 6x more likely to be obese, suggesting that the group already had underlying health factors.  Also, we have no idea how many people in the non-cannabis group actually used cannabis as they were never asked.  Certainly, many of them did use cannabis because the non-users were about 98% of the total sample size and we know for a fact that far more than 2% of the general population partakes in cannabis use.  Further, we have no idea how the cannabis users ingested cannabis or the frequency.  For example, if the cannabis group were people who were mostly obese and smoked it very regularly and already had symptoms along the way, there isn't much you can glean from comparing that group to random healthy people.

Marijuana users at greater risk for heart attack, stroke

Weed users are much more likely to suffer a heart attack, stroke or other life-threatening heart condition than people who don’t indulge, a new study says.

Adults under 50 are more than six times as likely to suffer a heart attack if they use marijuana, compared to non-users, researchers reported Tuesday in the journal JACC Advances.

They also have a dramatically higher risk of stroke, heart failure and heart-related death, researchers said.

Weed is legal for recreational use in 24 states and for medical use in 39 states.

These results show that it is not inherently harmless, even as it is legalized across the U.S., researchers said.

“At a policy level, a fair warning should be made so that the people who are consuming cannabis know that there are risks,” Kamel said.

For the study, researchers analyzed health records for more than 4.6 million adults younger than 50, comparing the heart health of cannabis users to non-users.

Everyone included in the study had no heart health problems at the outset.

Their blood pressure and cholesterol levels were within a healthy range, and they had no diabetes, tobacco use or indication of clogged arteries.

During an average follow-up of more than three years, weed users had:

• A more than sixfold increased risk of heart attack compared to non-users.

• Four times the risk of stroke.

• Twice the risk of heart failure.

• Triple the risk of heart-related death, heart attack or stroke.",9,1742559795.0,1jgfinq

https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00009-1

Summary

Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability, affecting more women than men. Different immune cells contribute to this sexual divergence, but the mechanisms, especially in females, are not well defined. We show that pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels on microglia and T cells differentially cause mechanical allodynia, a debilitating symptom of neuropathic pain. In male rodents, Panx1 drives vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) release from microglia. Cell-specific knockdown of microglial Panx1 or pharmacological blockade of the VEGF receptor attenuated allodynia in nerve-injured males. In females, nerve injury increased spinal CD8+ T cells and leptin levels. Leptin release from female-derived CD8+ T cells was Panx1 dependent, and intrathecal leptin-neutralizing antibody injection sex-specifically reversed allodynia. Adoptive transfer of female-derived CD8+ T cells caused robust allodynia, which was prevented by a leptin-neutralizing antibody or leptin small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. Panx1-targeted approaches may alleviate neuropathic pain in both sexes, while T cell- and leptin-directed treatments could have sex-dependent benefits for women.

Why pain medication may not be as effective for women as it is for men

UCalgary researchers reveal biological differences between the sexes when it comes to chronic pain

A new study led by University of Calgary professor Dr. Tuan Trang, PhD, may help to explain why there is an over-representation of women experiencing chronic pain compared to men. In 2019, the Canadian Pain Task Force report found chronic pain is more common among females of all ages, including children, when compared to males.

“Both males and females develop pain, but each sex develops it through different means,” says Trang, a professor in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and Cumming School of Medicine (CSM). “This study identifies a very unique type of biological process through a specific immune cell that is distinctive to each sex.”

The study, published in Neuron, focused on neuropathic pain, which is caused by injury to a nerve or the nervous system. A debilitating symptom of this is allodynia which is experienced when someone feels pain from a stimulus that does not typically cause pain. This condition can be very hard to treat; for instance, things like a light touch, temperature changes, and clothing against the skin can be agonizing. The study, conducted in rats and mice, found that in both sexes pain signals can be communicated by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels but through different types of immune cells. In female rodents, however, activation of Panx1 releases leptin, a hormone which has been associated with heightened pain sensitivity.",30,1742557214.0,1jgerd9

Mindfulness, total sleep quality, and alcohol consumption may help explain why people who stay up late have a greater risk of depression, according to a new study publishing March 19, 2025, in the open-access journal PLOS One by Simon Evans of University of Surrey, UK, and colleagues.

Previous research has shown that night owls who stay up late, called “evening chronotypes,” have more depression symptoms than people who are early risers, or “morning chronotypes.” In the new study, Evans and colleagues collected data from 546 university students using an online questionnaire. The data included self-reported information on the students’ sleep patterns, mindfulness, rumination tendencies, alcohol use, and depression and anxiety levels.

The study confirmed that people with an evening chronotype were at a notably higher risk for depression and that the association could be explained by differences in mindfulness, sleep quality, and alcohol consumption. On average, evening chronotypes had poorer sleep quality, higher alcohol consumption, and acted with less mindfulness than morning chronotypes.",3,1742521868.0,1jg5sjc

miyurjn,Potential_Being_7226,"From the press release:

To begin with, the researchers examined high-resolution tree canopy data to determine the structure of tree-covered green spaces within a radius of 500 metres of a person’s place of residence. In addition to recording the total area covered by all tree clusters, they also identified the proximity and connectedness of tree clusters, their geometrical complexity and the fragmentation level.

They linked this information with the survival time of the resident in the respective neighbourhood for over six million adults, i.e. looking exclusively at natural-cause deaths due to illness and old age. This data, supplied by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, covers over a ten-year period (2010–2019). In order to protect privacy, the Federal Statistical Office rounded the coordinates of citizens’ residences to the nearest 50 metres.

**Tree quantity and positioning both matter**

Data analysis shows that both the tree canopy cover in residential areas and their spatial arrangement correlate with mortality. The study identified a significantly lower mortality risk in people who live in neighbourhoods with large, contiguous and well networked areas of tree canopies than for people who live in areas with fewer, fragmented areas of tree canopies with complex geometries. This correlation is particularly evident in densely developed peri-urban and urban areas with poor air quality and high temperatures: if such areas feature well-structured forested green spaces, the residents may receive more health benefits than other areas.

Yet, while this study represents an important first step, it is still not possible to draw conclusions regarding the causes. The researchers are not yet able to state with precision the pathways through which tree canopy configuration influences human health. Nevertheless, the study’s findings at the individual level are generally consistent with the results of similar studies at the community level in Philadelphia, Tehran and Taipei.

From the linked article: 

Sex differences in brain structure are present at birth and remain stable during early development

New research published in Biology of Sex Differences has found that sex differences in brain structure are already present at birth and remain relatively stable during early postnatal development. The study found that while male infants tend to have larger total brain volumes, female infants, when adjusted for brain size, have more grey matter, whereas male infants have more white matter. These findings suggest that prenatal biological factors play a significant role in shaping early sex differences in brain structure.

The findings confirmed that male infants had larger total brain volumes compared to female infants, a pattern that has been consistently reported in older children and adults. However, when researchers adjusted for overall brain size, they found that female infants had significantly more grey matter, while male infants had more white matter.

Further analysis of specific brain regions showed that, even after accounting for differences in total brain volume, certain areas were larger in female infants, while others were larger in male infants. Female infants had relatively greater volumes in regions such as the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres of the brain, and the parahippocampal gyrus, an area involved in memory processing. Male infants had larger volumes in regions such as the medial and inferior temporal gyri, which are associated with visual and auditory processing.",851,1742491492.0,1jfu8nz

miu5ls6,zebrasmack,"\*On average

The study says ""On Average"". Meaning men could be 51% and women 49%, you'd be able to say ""On average"". Feels a bit misleading otherwise.

from the study:  
""Note on terminology: Throughout this paper, all references to “sex differences” or “on-average sex differences” are intended to reflect differences observed in group averages and not individual cases.

While sex differences in human brain anatomy are well-evidenced (for a meta-analysis, see \[[1](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR1)\]), their magnitude, significance, and implications remain a matter of substantial ongoing debate (for recent discussions, see \[[2](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR2), [3](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR3)\]). Most notably, their underlying causes are a central point of scientific discussion and remain poorly understood. This area of research is of high importance because the prevalence of various psychiatric, neurological, and neurodevelopmental conditions differs by biological sex \[[4](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR4), [5](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR5)\]. Given that variations in brain development are implicated in these conditions and overlap with neurobiological sex differences, it is likely that sex differences play a key role in the development of these conditions \[[4](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR4), [6](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR6), [7](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR7)\]. A better understanding of sex differences, their underlying causes, and their onset could therefore help tailor diagnostic, prognostic, and support strategies to facilitate optimal health outcomes.

Research into brain regional sex differences is even more limited and inconsistent, complicating the identification of regions that show reliable sex differences during early development. When using region-of-interest volumetry, one study reported no regional sex differences in early infancy after controlling for intracranial volume \[[14](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR14)\]. However, when using voxel-based approaches such as tensor- and deformation-based morphometry, other studies have reported various regional sex differences even after controlling for brain size \[[13](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR13), [14](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR14)\]. For instance, male infants had increased gray matter volumes in the insula, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and hippocampus, whilst female infants had increased volumes in the dorsolateral prefrontal, motor, and visual cortices \[[14](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR14)\].

In summary, a limited number of studies have investigated sex differences in neonatal brain structure. This gap is surprising as the prenatal and neonatal periods are amongst the most rapid periods of brain development \[[19](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR19),[20](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR20),[21](https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00657-5#ref-CR21)\] and are likely critical windows for understanding sex differences in brain development. Moreover, given that brain development is highly dynamic during the first few weeks of life, existing findings from later stages of infancy cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the neonatal period. Neonatal research also provides a pivotal opportunity to understand the origins of sex differences in the brain and, specifically, the role of prenatal and early postnatal development in shaping these differences. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged a sample of 514 newborns from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) to assess sex differences in global and regional brain volumes. We further incorporated sex-by-age interactions in our analysis to investigate sex differences in early postnatal brain development and understand the potential role early postnatal factors play in shaping these sex differences.""",25,1742494759.0,1jfu8nz

Hadn't picked out names, everything I bought in terms of décor and a few toys and clothing was gender neutral intentionally.

I bought her a combination of 'boys' and 'girls' toys, kept things to a minimum, nuetral clothing, nothing pink or girly, really, more just on the practical and cute side, because dammit, babies are CUTE!

That kid wanted nothing to do with cute boys toys like trucks and cars and things with wheels. On the few occasions we went to the actual toy store, she beelined for the **Everything Is Pink** aisle for girls, didn't want ANYTHING to do with the cute toys for boys. NOTHING. Except dinosaurs. She still *loves* dinosaurs. At least we have that. We didn't watch tv at all other than Barney & Sesame Street, and only ever had classic Disney videos, and of course back in the old days, there were no ipads & tablets. Ok fine, she did in fact grow up later watching Alien and Aliens on xmas morning, but that's a whole 'nuther Oprah.

I kept her out of the Barbies aisle of the toy store with determination. Until one fateful day, when she was about 2 years old, we went to a pool party at friends of friends house, with kids her age. On that day, she discovered *Barbies*. Yep, that kid became a Barbie addict. From then on, she had to have everything pink. Pink and cute and flowers.

I tried. I really tried and 'experimented' with consistently offering her choices on what she wanted in terms of clothing & toys and it was like offering a choice of an ice cream or fried liver. If it was pink and girly, that was the only choice, in her eyes.

miymwq5,jonnyyboyy,"From chatgpt:

If all else is equal and one animal has more grey matter while the other has more white matter, the two would likely differ in the type of brain function they excel at, rather than general intelligence or ability.

Here’s how they might differ:

1. Grey Matter-Rich Animal
	•	Grey matter is made up of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, and synapses. It’s where most of the brain’s processing and decision-making happens.
	•	Likely traits:
	•	Better at complex processing tasks like problem-solving, learning, or memory formation.
	•	Possibly more adaptive in unfamiliar or changing environments.
	•	Might have greater sensory perception or fine motor control, as grey matter density is high in areas like the cortex and cerebellum.

2. White Matter-Rich Animal
	•	White matter consists of myelinated axons that connect different parts of the brain. It’s responsible for communication between regions.
	•	Likely traits:
	•	Faster and more efficient transmission of information between brain areas.
	•	Better at coordination, both mentally (e.g. multitasking, integrating sensory input) and physically (e.g. smooth, rapid movement).
	•	Possibly more refined instinctive behaviors or faster reaction times, depending on how the white matter is organized.

Analogy

Think of grey matter as processors in a computer (CPU cores), and white matter as the wiring (bus speed or bandwidth). More processors allow for more or deeper thought, but better wiring means faster data sharing between processors.

So:
	•	More grey matter = potentially deeper thinking, higher processing power.
	•	More white matter = potentially faster, more coordinated responses.

miygjk0,LiveSir2395,"Sounds a bit confusing, as it suggests that the birds do this on purpose. These hummingbirds are not taking any approach, instead the pressure by natural selection drives evolution, so that the females end up with male plumage, which might help them to dodge aggression. Or, females with male plumage, have a higher survival rate, and the cause for them having male plumage is favorable natural selection.",13,1742556831.0,1jgel11
miyfrej,chrisdh79,"From the article: It’s been known for some time that some — but not all — female white-necked jacobin hummingbirds take on the brightly colored plumage worn by males. In a study [published](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347225000314?dgcid=coauthor) February 19 in Animal Behaviour, a team of researchers from the UW and Carnegie Mellon University have discovered the reason: They’re mimicking males. That trickery results in reduced aggression from other hummingbirds and increased access to nectar resources. 

“This research takes a mental model we’ve been describing for a while in our papers and gives it a mathematical backbone,” said Jay Falk, an evolutionary biologist who led this research while working as a postdoctoral scholar in the UW biology department. “It can be easy to think of natural selection as a force that is constantly choosing one single optimum. But this model adds to our understanding of how diversity, especially diversity within sexes, can be a stable endgame.” 

Relying on the principles of game theory and incorporating previously collected behavioral data, the researchers developed a model of hummingbird behavior to better understand how some birds choose their colors. The findings showed that “hybrid signals” — an equilibrium that can occur when signalers in a given situation may be dishonest — likely exist in nature.  

“In these hummingbirds, females want to mimic males,” said Kevin Zollman, a co-author of the study and director of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Complex Social Dynamics. “If they all did that, then they would end up being disbelieved. So, they end up settling into an equilibrium where some of them ‘lie,’ and they are sometimes ‘believed.’”",3,1742556466.0,1jgel11

To expand on some of the discussion of the comments, antibiotics are fairly blunt as they kill broad range of bacteria (good and bad) and do have some significant drawbacks but overall are an invaluable tool to fight infections.
Phages (aka bacteriophage) are viruses that kils bacteria. Those have a much narrower target range and only kill one or few types of bacteria.
There is a lot of research going on to use phage for medical treatment of certain infections. There potentially a lot of benefits over antibiotics but there are still many limitations (especially in the delivery of the phages in a way to reach the infection).

miyrdw8,Potential_Being_7226,"From the press release:

Epigenetic modifications are chemical changes in DNA and its associated proteins that regulate gene activity without altering their sequence. One of the most studied modifications is DNA methylation, a process in which methyl groups—small molecules composed of one carbon and three hydrogen atoms—are added to specific regions of the DNA. This mechanism, essential for development, environmental adaptation, and disease predisposition, is influenced by genetics and responds to factors such as diet, stress, and exposure to pollutants.

The study results indicate that schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression disorder are the neuropsychiatric disorders most strongly linked to DNA methylation in the placenta. Other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism, show some potentially causal associations, although to a lesser extent, while no visible effects were found in other analyzed pathologies. “These findings reinforce the hypothesis that schizophrenia and other disorders have a neurodevelopmental origin and that the placenta plays a fundamental role in this process,” explains Dr. Fernandez-Jimenez.

Actual fertility rate? No correlation whatsoever.

Iran has the same fertility rate as Denmark and the UAE has lower fertility rates than Switzerland or the Netherlands. And Japanese and South Korean women are certainly not considered the most ""emancipated"" and yet have lower fertility rates than any developed Western country.

Also,



1. Collapsing birthrates is not a developed world phenomenon. It is not a Western world phenomenon. This is a GLOBAL phenomenon. China, Mexico, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey, Vietnam, Argentina, Iran, Thailand, Indonesia, The Philippines, Colombia, Malaysia, etc...are all at or bellow population replacement. The only places that are still having high birthrates are sub-Saharan Africa and parts of central Asia.
2. We don't know exactly what is causing this, as this is happening in rich and poor countries alike. It is happening in countries with massive social-welfare safety nets and subsidies and in countries with none of those. It is happening in secular countries and in highly religious countries alike. The only common pattern seems to be urbanization. Scandinavian countries, countries like Singapore, Japan and South Korea have invested massive amounts of money trying to revert birthrates declines with not much to show for it. Singapore for example virtually guarantees affordable housing for all of its citizens, plus free schooling, affordable medical care, etc... and still has one of the lowest birthrates in the planet. No country has yet figured out how to reverse the trend, but many are trying.
3. Nobody is pushing for ""infinite growth"". Most people agree that flat population growth or a small decline is good. The problem is the pace of the decline. When birthrates fall off a cliff, as we are seeing now, you end up with a massively large old population that needs to be supported by an ever declining young population.

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319081

Abstract

The prevalence of voluntary childlessness is rising in Europe, likely accompanied by growing social acceptance. However, more evidence is needed on how to measure this acceptance in comparative surveys. This study examines two dimensions of voluntary childlessness: prescriptive and proscriptive. The aim of this study is to show how the two dimensions differ in measuring voluntary childlessness and to highlight the factors that shape these attitudes. Findings reveal that socio-demographic variables relate differently to the two dimensions of the acceptance of voluntary childlessness for men and women. At the macro level, lower gender inequality predicts higher acceptance of voluntary childlessness across both dimensions. Conversely, higher childlessness rates are associated with favourable attitudes only in the prescriptive dimension, while country-level religiosity does not predict either dimension. The study underscores the importance of distinguishing between dimensions of voluntary childlessness, as different factors shape their acceptance. Additionally, no differences emerge in attitudes toward voluntary childlessness for males and females.

From the linked article:

How does the country you live in affect your views on staying childless? A study compared people’s attitudes towards voluntary childlessness across 27 European countries and found that different results may emerge depending on whether the measurement focuses on social expectations or perceived consequences. They found that people in countries with higher childlessness rates tended to have higher acceptance of voluntary childlessness when thinking about perceived consequences, but no such trend was seen when thinking about societal expectations. People in countries with more gender equality had higher rates of acceptance overall, and the researchers say this may be because women play a larger role in economic stability and are seen in roles beyond motherhood. Women, more highly educated people, and young people were also more likely to be accepting, potentially due to a heightened awareness of the physical, emotional, psychological and career costs of having kids.

More and more people in Europe are choosing not to have children, prompting researchers to study how attitudes towards voluntary childlessness may be evolving.",13,1742466509.0,1jfls8i

This then combines with so many people having bad childhoods. Millennials watched terrorism on live TV then global economic crash when they were supposed to join the work force. Gen Z got a literal pandemic and their wellbeing sacrificed to protect the older wealth hoarding generation who didn't even want to follow basic hygiene rules like covering their mouth. Many people were pushed to raise their siblings due to the parents being busy working as the 90s onwards saw single income households harder and harder to maintain.



And then it gets so much worse. Millennials and Gen Z have grown up seeing Climate Change denial and greed willingly destroy the planet and ignore science. Again the older generations letting down the younger generations. We saw with the Ozone how the global governments can work together and they then decided it isn't worth doing again.



It is entirely reasonable to see people not wanting to make their own lives worse to force children to grow up in even worse conditions.

It's easier for lucky couples that have the income to have a stay at home parent, but still there's just no village and only one parent which can be overwhelming and comes at the cost of stress and strain on the relationship of the parents leading to even further isolation within the relationship of the parents itself and often eventual divorce.",4,1742482482.0,1jfls8i

mis6mm6,tortiesrock,"I work with children and teenagers  and I think the main causes are:

- Hopelessness: people don’t see a good future so they are refusing to bring children to it. 

- Negative views of paternity: the bar to be a good parent is way to high: people think they are bad parents because they cannot read to their children everyday, make the whole balanced meals from scratch and play with them 24/7. A good enough parent is a good parent. Children need to be fed, housed, cleaned, dressed and loved. It might be an oversimplification. But if you need to clean the bathrooms or do a work report and you tell your children to go play in their room so you can do those things, you are not a bad parent. Parenting has become too time consuming and exhausting so people don’t bother. 

- Industries that thrive in parental anxiety: there are way too many professionals giving contradictory advice about child rearing. And most of them have the solution right there: paying them for whatever product or service they are selling. It is creating anxious parents and making shady people rich. The last fad in my area: children have to visit a podologist for some specially fitted shoes. It’s nonsense. And it contributes to negative views of paternity.

- School and working hours that don’t match.

- People have to decide to get pregnant: people used to get pregnant because it happened. Now, thankfully, we have to plan it. But that creates a lot of hesitancy and anxiety because it is a life changing decision. And people receive bad advice like: you have to be 100% sure of it. However, some people, like me, have a baseline anxious personality that makes it very difficult for us to take decisions. I have had to make very difficult decisions in the past, and I have never ever been 100% of any of it. There is always that little voice telling you: “what if…”. If you are mostly sure, you are sure.

- Some people are treating other like commodities: The objetification of relationships is real. People are more individualistic than ever. It is good to set boundaries and look for healthy relationships. But some people are “my way or no way” and refuse to grow alongside with a partner or friend. I will not tolerate abuse, but I can tolerate people being annoying. As a result we are lonelier than ever: more single people, less friends, smaller families, no community… And mental health issues are skyrocketing as a result.

- Older grandparents who live far away: extended family has always helped with child care. But grandparents are getting older and need care themselves. Related to the former point, most people are flat out refusing to help. And I agree that you should not offload childcare to grandparents or uncles. But as long as there is some reciprocity, is good to help friends and family.

- Negative view of children: dealing with children is a skill you learn. And as there are fewer children around and out of public view, people have become less tolerant to them. There is also a huge decline in manners, because parents are not disciplining their children. Children need discipline, boundaries, rules. Sometimes they cannot get what they want, sometimes they will be bored and sometimes they have to be told NO.

To everybody who is on the fence: you are going to be a good parent, you are not going to be perfect but you will be the best parents your child will ever have. Your sons and daughters will only be babies and children for a very tiny part of their lives and, and as a reward for your parenting you will have a beautiful relationship with your adult offspring for the rest of your life.",30,1742472627.0,1jfls8i

""Residential solar photovoltaics (PV) are important for a rapid decarbonization strategy. To chart an equitable energy transition, researchers have measured inequalities in residential PV adoption and identified factors that drive group disparities. We know little, however, about people’s experiences after installing solar. Electricity generation differences among PV systems can be substantial and may contribute to inequitable outcomes even as adoption disparities wane. Here we use data measuring actual monthly generation for over 26,000 PV systems installed in Connecticut to identify significant disparities in system output by neighbourhood income and race. We show that the choice of financing model (purchase or leasing) partly explains the observed disparities. We also find that system generation varies significantly across installers, highlighting that firm behaviour contributes to inequitable outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of measuring the quality and the quantity of renewable energy projects to ensure an equitable energy transition.""",4,1742567032.0,1jgi03j

Using harmonized longitudinal survey data (2012–2018) from the United States, England, 18 European countries, Israel and China, we found that at least one-fifth of persons with dementia and functional limitations received no personal assistance for basic activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living, regardless of regional development level. Care gaps were widespread across both basic activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living limitations, as well as for informal and formal care. Disparities were evident, with less educated people more likely to lack formal care, whereas those living alone often lacked informal support, resulting in the absence of any care. Alarmingly, care availability showed no improvement over time.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/19485506241306869

From the linked article: 

A recent study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science suggests that people’s tendency to act in cooperative and generous ways may influence their political views in the long run. Researchers found that individuals who exhibited greater prosocial behavior in economic decision-making tasks were more likely to develop political attitudes favoring social equality and income redistribution over time. However, the reverse was not true—political views did not appear to shape later prosocial tendencies.

“In our study, we explored the link between people’s political beliefs and their prosocial preferences: the extent to which people are willing to benefit others at a cost to themselves. Prior research has already shown that left-wing people are more prosocial, but it is not clear whether this is just a statistical association or whether prosocial preferences play a causal role in the expression of political beliefs.”

The study revealed a one-way relationship: prosocial tendencies predicted political beliefs, but political beliefs did not predict prosocial tendencies. Specifically, people who displayed more prosocial behavior in the first wave of data collection were more likely to shift toward lower Social Dominance Orientation 18 months later. They also tended to show greater support for income redistribution over time. However, the reverse was not true—having certain political views at the start of the study did not predict changes in prosocial behavior later on.",20,1742473076.0,1jfnim1

It’s a memory of trying very hard to bite something that looked “good to bite”, but my mother kept it slightly out of my reach. I was crying in a level of frustration and “desire to bite” that was seemingly strongly felt enough, and possibly traumatic(?) enough, to cause a memory from babyhood. And according to my mother, the thing I was trying to bite (a rubber medical thing for  hitting my back and breaking up chest congestion), was only used when I was a quite young baby.

So for the next few years I made a point to obsessively ruminate on everything I could remember about my life and replay as many memories in my head as I could.

This wasn't healthy, but it did actually 'beat' childhood amnesia because I ended up reinforcing a bunch of very early memories. I have one from when I was about nine months old that my mom is certain is real. (No adult would have reinforced it, and it involves a furniture configuration at my grandma's place that wasn't photoghed & changed before I turned two so there's no way I could just spontaneously go 'that crib used to be under the red hook, and faced in this direction,' unless I remembered it.)

Also there's a couple of things I remember from before my brother was born (so I would have been under 2.5 years old) that I know are real & not adult reenforced because when I brought them up as an adult, my dad turned white and blurted out 'You weren't supposed to remember that!' (He tricked me into killing a squirrel, and got me to ruin my mom's record player because he wanted to throw it away. I ratted him out in college after talking to friends and realizing what had *actually* happened in those memories.

mirrc88,chrisdh79,"From the article: An international team of scientists including those from Australia’s Charles Darwin University (CDU) has [developed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666990025000059?via%3Dihub) a novel AI model known as ECgMPL, which can assess microscopic images of cells and tissue to identify endometrial cancer – one of the most common forms of reproductive tumors – with an impressive 99.26% accuracy. And the researchers say it can be adapted to identify a broad range of disease, including colorectal and oral cancer.

“The proposed ECgMLP model outperforms existing methods by achieving 99.26 percent accuracy, surpassing transfer learning and custom models discussed in the research while being computationally efficient,” said the study’s co-author Dr. Asif Karim, from CDU. “Optimized through ablation studies, self-attention mechanisms, and efficient training, ECgMLP generalizes well across multiple histopathology datasets thereby making it a robust and clinically applicable solution for endometrial cancer diagnosis.”

What that science-speak means is that the well-trained model is able to look at these microscopic scans – histopathology images – and enhance image quality in order to identify early stages of cancer, homing in on certain areas of the scans to pinpoint problematic growth that may not be easily detected by the naked eye. Right now, current human-led diagnostic methods are around 78.91% to 80.93% accurate. Endometrial cancer is treatable and, if found in time, has a good five-year outcome for patients. However, once it spreads outside the uterus, it becomes difficult to effectively treat – which makes timely diagnosis critical in saving lives.

Currently, more than 600,000 Americans have battled the disease. And while this cancer may not personally impact half of the population, the scientists confirm that ECgMLP analysis has much broader application than what it has been trained on.

“The same methodology can be applied for fast and accurate early detection and diagnosis of other diseases which ultimately leads to better patient outcomes,” said co-author Niusha Shafiabady, an associate professor at ACU. “We evaluated the model on several histopathology image datasets. It diagnosed colorectoral cancer with 98.57% per cent accuracy, breast cancer with 98.20% accuracy, and oral cancer with 97.34% accuracy.”",27,1742465005.0,1jflda6

mizrzcm,WarningRepulsive4903,"Here's the abstract: 

**Introduction:** Citalopram and escitalopram are among the most used medications and are key treatments for many psychiatric disorders. Previous findings suggest citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates are changing because of the patent for citalopram ending as opposed to evidence of a clear therapeutic advantage-so-called ""evergreening"". This retrospective study focuses on characterizing the chronologic and geographic variation in the use of citalopram and escitalopram from 2015 to 2020 among US Medicaid and Medicare patients. We hypothesized that prescription rates of citalopram will decrease with a concurrent increase in escitalopram, consistent with ""evergreening"".

**Methods:** Citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates and costs per state were obtained from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database and Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data. States' annual prescription rates outside a 95% confidence interval were considered significantly different from the average.

**Results:** Overall, a decreasing trend for citalopram and an increasing trend for escitalopram prescription rates were noted in both Medicare and Medicaid patients. The differences between generic and brand were noted for both drugs, with generic forms being less expensive than the brand-name version.

**Discussion:** Despite limited evidence suggesting that citalopram and escitalopram have any meaningful differences in therapeutic or adverse effects, there exists a noticeable decline in the use of citalopram that cooccurred with an increase in escitalopram prescribing, consistent with our hypothesis. Moreover, among these general pharmacoepidemiologic trends exists significant geographic variability. There was disproportionate spending (relative to their use) on the brand versions of these medicines relative to their generic forms.

Abstract

We aimed to assess the psychoeducational quality of TikTok content about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from the perspective of both mental health professionals and young adults across two pre-registered studies. In Study 1, two clinical psychologists with expertise in ADHD evaluated the claims (accuracy, nuance, overall quality as psychoeducation material) made in the top 100 #ADHD TikTok videos. Despite the videos’ immense popularity (collectively amassing nearly half a billion views), fewer than 50% of the claims about ADHD symptoms were judged to align with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. In Study 2, 843 undergraduate students (no ADHD =  224, ADHD self-diagnosis =  421, ADHD formal diagnosis =  198) were asked about their typical frequency of viewing #ADHD content on TikTok and their perceptions of ADHD and were shown the top 5 and bottom 5 psychologist-rated videos from Study 1. A greater typical frequency of watching ADHD-related TikToks was linked to a greater willingness to recommend both the top and bottom-rated videos from Study 1, after controlling for demographics and ADHD diagnostic status. It was also linked to estimating a higher prevalence of ADHD in the general population and greater challenges faced by those with ADHD. Our findings highlight a discrepancy between mental health professionals and young adults regarding the psychoeducational value of #ADHD content on TikTok. Addressing this is crucial to improving access to treatment and enhancing support for those with ADHD.

From the linked article:

ADHD misinformation on TikTok is shaping young adults’ perceptions

An analysis of the 100 most-viewed TikTok videos related to ADHD revealed that fewer than half the claims about symptoms actually align with clinical guidelines for diagnosing ADHD.

The study found that the more ADHD-related TikTok content a young adult consumes, the more likely they are to overestimate both the prevalence and severity of ADHD symptoms in the general population. Participants who watched more of this content were also more likely to recommend the videos—despite the unreliability of the information.

Clinical psychologists gave the more accurate ADHD videos an average rating of 3.6 out of five, while young adults gave them 2.8.

The psychologists rated the least reliable videos at 1.1 out of five. Young adults rated them significantly higher at 2.3.",154,1742416142.0,1jf6vew

I've worked with a wide variety of families and individuals both through schools, as a CPS worker and now as a behavioral health specialist in a JDC, ADHD is still missed often. The problem is that trauma symptoms overlap with ADHD.

Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected. This gets strongly socialized out of people before adulthood. It can instead show up as pacing, needing a lot of physical activity to stay regulated, almost always needing to be doing something, etc.

Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is not appropriate (adolescents or adults may be limited to feeling restless). Oh look the only one with a specific adolescent/adult symptom and it's just generic restlessness.

Often unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly. This also gets strongly socialized out of kids long before adulthood. Masking this is common. Could show up as ""trash talking"" in teens and adults.

Is often “on the go” acting as if “driven by a motor.” This is a primary symptom that can make it to adulthood.

Studies indicate that 15–25% of youth with ADHD meet the criteria for ASD, whereas 50–70% of those with ASD have comorbid ADHD [4]. There is well-established research highlighting the high prevalence of a wide variety of sleep problems in ADHD and ASD.

For decades, ship emissions steadily rose as increasing global trade drove higher ship traffic. Then, in 2020, new international regulations cut ships’ sulfur emissions by 77%. Our newly published research shows how lightning over shipping lanes dropped by half almost overnight after the regulations went into effect.

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/abstract](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/abstract)

Anti-amyloid drug shows signs of preventing Alzheimer’s dementia

An experimental drug appears to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s-related dementia in people destined to develop the disease in their 30s, 40s or 50s, according to the results of a study led by the Knight Family Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network-Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), which is based at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The findings suggest – for the first time in a clinical trial – that early treatment to remove amyloid plaques from the brain many years before symptoms arise can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s dementia.

The study is published March 19 in The Lancet Neurology.

The international study involved 73 people with rare, inherited genetic mutations that cause the overproduction of amyloid in the brain, all but guaranteeing that they will develop Alzheimer’s disease in middle age. For a subgroup of 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study’s start and who received the drug the longest – an average of eight years – the treatment lowered the risk of developing symptoms from essentially 100% to about 50%, according to a primary analysis of the data and supported by multiple sensitivity analyses supporting the trend. 

The findings provide new evidence to support the so-called amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease, which posits that the first step on the road to dementia is the build-up of amyloid plaques in the brain, and that removing such plaques or blocking their formation can stop symptoms from arising. For this study, Bateman and colleagues evaluated the effects of an experimental anti-amyloid drug to see if the medication could prevent the development of dementia.",188,1742435634.0,1jfe1zz

>Gantenerumab and other anti-amyloid drugs have been linked to a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. The abnormalities are detectable on brain scans and represent tiny spots of blood in the brain or localized swelling of the brain. In clinical trials, most cases of ARIA aren’t noticed by participants (that is, they show no symptoms) and resolve on their own, but a minority are more serious and, rarely, deaths have been linked to the side effect. In this study, ARIA rates were one-third higher than in the original clinical trial (30% vs 19%), which the researchers attribute to the higher doses used in the extension. Two participants developed such severe ARIA that they needed to be taken off the drug, at which point they recovered.


As far as I understand what I've read elsewhere, something that was obscuring the positive effects of amyloid removal was that preventing buildup is safer than loosening and removing build-up, which for some can wreak a smol havok. The vasculature needs to be resilient enough to handle no longer being propped up, and maybe even handle being dinged.

I feel like hormones in particular are underdiscussed in supporting healthy vasculature. And there are so many lifestyle improvements, too.

I’m in England, I see similar studies regarding my own country, but there is absolutely no possibility that the farmland that surrounds me, which is presently used for cattle and sheep could ever be ploughed by machinery, it is simply too steep (10-20% inclines and narrow valley bottoms).

mis04rk,James_Fortis,"""**Abstract**

Background/Objectives: Agricultural systems face increasing global pressure to address sustainability challenges, particularly regarding land use and environmental protection. In Romania, where traditional diets are heavily dependent on animal-based products, optimizing land use is critical. This study investigates the potential of plant-based diets to reduce agricultural land use, examining scenarios of partial and complete replacement of animal protein with plant protein sources (soy, peas, and potatoes). Methods: The research modeled three dietary transition scenarios—replacing 33%, 50%, and 100% of animal protein with plant-based protein—using data from the Romanian National Institute of Statistics, the FAO, and international sources. Land use was calculated for each scenario using formulas that take into account protein content and land use intensity for animal and plant protein sources. The simulations quantify the reduction in agricultural land use at the per capita and national levels. Results: The study reveals significant land-saving potential across all scenarios. At the national level, land use reductions ranged from 84,020 hectares (33% replacement) to **1,067,443 hectares** (100% replacement). High-impact products such as beef and dairy continue to dominate land use, even in partial replacement scenarios. Conversely, replacing pork and chicken proteins shows substantial savings. The findings highlight the inefficiency of animal-based protein production and the ecological benefits of transitioning to plant-based diets. Conclusions: **A dietary shift towards plant-based protein in Romania could achieve significant reductions in agricultural land use**, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. This transition not only supports environmental conservation and resource optimization, but also provides public health benefits by reducing consumption of red and processed meat. These results provide a basis for policies to promote sustainable and nutritionally balanced food systems""",6,1742469704.0,1jfml88

Other people have pointed out that 12 weeks isn't sufficient to see changes in mass and I tend to agree. There are other publications that looked at muscle biopsies directly in a double blind trial of creatine vs control and found additional myosatellite cell nuclei donation rates to muscle cells in treatment vs control. They didn't report muscle mass differences, but increased nuclei in the skeletal muscle fibers is a precursor to expanding muscle fiber size. I consider actually visualizing the cells at the physiological level and seeing an actual difference in cell phenotype to be more impactful than measuring gross muscle mass change in such a short time scale.


Now the argument could be made that creatine itself didn't cause this but rather enabled the treatment group to work more explosively than the control group, but correlation/causation aside, the average gym user would only care about the end result anyway.

[The study,](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/6/1081) published in Nutrients, details a 12-week clinical trial investigating the effects of creatine on lean body mass.

The key finding of the study is that a combination of resistance training and creatine (taken at the daily maintenance level of 5 grams) has little to no effect on lean body mass over the 12-week period when compared to resistance training without the supplement.

**Other key points from the study:**

* Half the participants of the study completed a wash-in phase where they began taking creatine a week before their resistance training program began. In this first week those in the wash-in group DID gain more lean body mass, however, the gains they made varied greatly and dropped back to match the control group over time. The researchers believe these gains were likely not real muscle growth and instead was fluid retention.
* All study participants were put through the same training program and had their measurements taken at multiple stages using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry which measures bone mineral density and body composition. Additionally, participants were required to keep a food log three days prior to each assessment, which showed no significant differences in their diets.
* Participants taking creatine bypassed a loading phase, which included taking 20 to 25 grams daily for up to one week.

The findings of the study suggest that people may need to take more than the recommended daily level of creatine to see desired gains.

1. Exercise program details. The program itself was actually fine, the issue was that they relied on RPE for novice lifters. This is just flat-out not going to work as a reliable measure of intensity. Even people who have been lifting for a while can struggle with getting this to be accurate. This makes me nervous that they didn't adequately handle progressive overload for the supplemented group (well, either group, but in particular the supplemented group). The main benefit of creatine is pretty dependent on leveraging it to get more intensity out of the workout.

2. These people were untrained, so it honestly wouldn't surprise me if the bulk of muscle growth was indeed  basically unaffected by creatine. That's fine, it was the scope of the study, but we know how quickly untrained people build muscle.

Question: Do Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory monitors equitably represent the US population across race and ethnicity?

Findings: This cross-sectional study with 329 725 481 individuals found that monitoring disparities exist for all criteria pollutants, particularly sulfur dioxide and lead, followed by ozone and carbon monoxide. Disparities were consistent across most racial and ethnic groups but were generally largest for those of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander race and American Indian or Alaska Native race.

mis5pqg,chrisdh79,"From the article: People are more likely to take part in protests and other forms of collective action when the cause aligns with their political values. However, new research suggests that political extremism itself—regardless of ideology—also drives activism. A study [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pops.70008) in Political Psychology found that individuals with extreme political beliefs, whether on the left or the right, are more likely to engage in collective action, even if the movement does not align with their ideology. The findings suggest that emotions, particularly anger, play a central role in this relationship.

“Both societal and fundamental interests inspired this research. At the societal level, there is a longstanding debate about the role of political extremes in social movements. In France, this question became particularly salient during the Yellow Vest movement, with analysts attempting to categorize the movement as left-wing, right-wing, or simply extreme,” explained Gaëlle Marinthe, an associate professor at Clermont Auvergne University.

“On the fundamental side, I am deeply interested in the similarities and differences between groups with ideologically opposing viewpoints. My colleagues and I wanted to examine the influence of both ideological values and a more cognitive feature of one’s ideological position (i.e., extremism) in political investment and, in this study, collective action. Our research is based on the premise that values and beliefs indeed play a major role in political behavior. However, structural features of ideology or belief (and in this case, extremism) may operate similarly across different ideological groups and may sometimes lead to counterintuitive outcomes—potentially even undermining the group’s long-term objectives.”",8,1742472239.0,1jfna8t

mincdu0,colacolette,"I actually study mild traumatic brain injury. Some populations with high levels of head injury: veterans, homeless, prisoners. Its hard to say with any certainty that mild head injuries affect decision making (i.e. are the CAUSE of felonious behavoir). In fact, it's quite hard to say conclusively that mild concussions do much of anything. This isn't to say that mild head injuries, especially high volumes of them, dont have an effect on the brain and behavior. But scientifically, it's a bit of a conundrum. 

Most mild head injuries heal within 3-6 months, with no visible changes in any kind of brain scans, and no statistical differences in cognitive tasks. However, mild head injuries have been linked to mental health conditions,  substance abuse, and risk taking behavior. What's especially difficult is attributing these things to the injury that, by all account, should have healed fully. Scientifically, it's an incredibly difficult topic and opinions vary from ""mild TBI has no medical impact"" to ""multiple mTBIs may cause CTE and alzheimers"". When we discuss more severe head injuries (loss of consciousness>1 hour, skull fractures, actual tissue damage), it becomes more clear that behavioral and cognitive problems do arise. But the vast majority of head injuries are mild in nature, making the whole thing very muddy, with studies displaying a vast array of outcomes.

On the populations listed above, it gets particularly complicated. These groups share a number of issues, including HIGH rates of psychological trauma and abuse, particularly in childhood. Abuse victims have higher rates of head injury. They also have higher rates of mental health conditions and addiction. Not to mention, childhood trauma survivors display neurological differences from the trauma itself. Puzzling out which of these is responsible for changes in behavior is incredibly difficult.",298,1742403831.0,1jf0p7s
min1wkw,Wagamaga,"Currently, adult male prisoners comprise more than 90% of the prison population. In this study sample of 286 adult males, demographically representative of approximately 8,000 adult males in prison in Scotland, significant head injury was found in 86% of the prisoners. The research also showed that 35% of that group – 151 of the study participants overall – had experienced repeated head injuries routinely over long periods of time. The most frequent cause was violence, although many had head injuries from many causes.

Disability was associated with significant head injury in 35% of those studied, and while the research found a strong association with problematic drug or alcohol use, a history of serious head injury was also associated with clinical anxiety and clinical depression. Disability after head injury was also associated with difficulties with social relationships, and poorer self-control, for example with temper, all risk factors for criminal behaviour.

Prisoners who had experienced significant head injury were also more likely to have had more arrests, charges and convictions and at younger ages, and were at greater risk of involvement in violent crime and property offences than those prisoners without head injury.

mipz9rj,chrisdh79,"From the article: Human speech arises courtesy of some significant neural horsepower. Different areas of the brain are involved in determining the meaning that's desired, finding the words to express it, and then converting those words to a specific series of sounds—and all that comes before the correct sequence of nerve impulses is sent to the muscles that produce the final output. Humans are far from alone in the animal kingdom with an impressive range of vocalizations, though. That raises the prospect that we can understand a bit more about our own speech by studying how vocalization is managed in different animals.

One group of species that's especially interesting is birds. They're distant relatives compared to other animals with interesting vocal capabilities, like whales and elephants, and their brains have some notable differences from ours. They also show a range of behaviors, from complex songs to vocal mimicry to whatever it is that you want to call what parrots do. Thanks to a newly released study, however, we now have evidence that these different types of vocalization are the product of different control systems in the brain.

[The study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08695-8) relied on electrodes placed in the brains of parrots and songbirds and tracked the behavior of neurons in a region that controls vocalization. It showed that the two relied on different types of control, with parrots having a system that operates similarly to the one used by humans.

The work focused on two species of birds. One is the zebra finch, a songbird that learns to produce a short song it uses each year, in part by listening to what its peers are singing. The second is the budgerigar, a small parrot that's often kept as a pet. Budgerigars are both impressive vocal mimics and also have complex vocalizations called warbles that are a mix of noisy and harmonic calls.

Due to past work, we've already identified the brain structure that controls the activity of the key vocal organ, the syrinx, located in the bird's throat. The new study, done by Zetian Yang and Michael Long of New York University, managed to place fine electrodes into this area of the brain in both species and track the activity of neurons there while the birds were awake and going about normal activities. This allowed them to associate neural activity with any vocalizations made by the birds. For the budgerigars, they had an average of over 1,000 calls from each of the four birds carrying the implanted electrodes.",19,1742432892.0,1jfd5cz

https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/02/bmjebm-2024-112974

From the linked article: 

Only 10% of non-surgical treatments for back problems kill pain, says review

Only six out of 56 treatments analysed yielded ‘small’ relief according to most comprehensive worldwide study, with some even increasing pain

Most treatments for back pain do not work and even the few that do bring little relief, a global review of the evidence on one of the world’s commonest health problems has found.

Six in 10 adults in the UK live with lower back pain at some point. Symptoms can include excruciating pain, restricted movement, inability to work and reluctance to mix socially. Some people feel better within weeks but others can find their life dominated by chronic pain for years.

The wide range of treatment available includes painkillers, acupuncture, stretching, massage, anti-inflammatory drugs, laser and light therapy, and manipulation of the spine.

However, the bad news for the many who endure back pain is that only 10% of these non-surgical treatments usually deployed actually have any effect – and the rest provide little or no benefit.

Only six out of the 56 treatments analysed are effective and even those yield only “small” relief. The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.

That is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.

Australian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.

“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.",1,1742376463.0,1jet0pz
milabr4,LifeofTino,"Also worth noting that surgical treatments for back issues are also notorious for having a low success rate, with some studies finding surgical treatments to be less successful than non-surgical on average

Back problems were also the canary in the mine around diagnostics. When given blind tests (scan results from past patients), doctors have a low success rate at correctly identifying what the problem was. And, just as famously, lots of scans showed people with significant issues (including bulged discs) that had zero pain, and people with a lot of pain with no diagnosable issues at all

Which led to diagnostic reforms, because if someone had an issue with something that had no scan indication, and also had something on the scan that wasn’t causing an issue, this would lead to a misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment. Which is partly the cause of such poor results when it comes to back issues

So, back issues are so well known for having incredibly poor treatment success across all healthcare that they have had major impacts on all therapy and diagnostic practices",1346,1742377834.0,1jet0pz
milstp7,SaulsAll,"The important part to me:

>The one treatment that does help those with acute low-back pain is **non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**, they found. In addition, five treatments also bring some relief for chronic low-back pain: **exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, taping, antidepressants and what are known as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TPRV1) drugs.**

>But three treatments for acute back pain do not work – exercise, glucocortisoid injections and taking paracetamol. And two for chronic back pain are also ineffective – antibiotics and anaesthetics.

>However, the evidence for the other 45 treatments is “inconclusive”. The researchers assessed and offered a judgement on the extent to which they all relieved pain. Despite some of them being very popular, most “may provide modest reductions in pain”, they said.",155,1742385939.0,1jet0pz
mim433n,HerbertWest,"I'm someone who's had back surgery twice, both for severely ruptured discs. I'm actually currently recovering from the second surgery.

Anyway, trust me when I say that insurance companies are complete POS when it comes to these issues. As I was in excruciating pain, my leg was literally going numb, and I was developing a limp due to muscle weakness, they said I had to go through ""6 weeks of less intensive treatment"" *before they would cover even an MRI*. Luckily, it wasn't my first rodeo, so I was able to get an MRI covered by going to the urgent care repeatedly, trying a bunch of non-opiod stuff like muscle relaxers, and, finally, going to the ER and insisting upon it. This is what I had to do last time, too, which was around 13 years ago. It was a tad easier then only because they prescribed opioids in the meantime, while I was jumping through hoops. They obviously don't do that anymore.

It's very important to have doctors at every repeated visit consistently note that your condition is deteriorating, that you feel you can't complete simple activities of daily living (in my case, true), and that you feel you aren't being taken seriously enough. I asked every doctor I went to whether they saw this ending in anything other than surgery and all of them either said they had no clue or, if they had more experience, that, no, it was too severe for other treatment to work.

But, yeah, when they finally covered the MRI, they found that I had severe nerve compression (big surprise). Despite that, the surgeon had to appeal twice to get the surgery covered! And complete a peer-to-peer call. I was told that the only reason they covered it in my case was the weakness. If it were just the other symptoms, I would have had to suffer another 6 weeks just to get to the same place. By that point, I would have been out of PTO at work and on unpaid FMLA leave, putting me in a financial hole.

The entire process is designed to get people who need surgery to put up with life-altering, crippling, ruining pain out of either fear or ignorance in order to save insurance companies money.",44,1742390247.0,1jet0pz
milzj0n,Oisy,"This study found that exercise was effective for chronic low back pain, but ineffective for acute back pain. I would be interested to know the length and degree of exercise which was prescribed. I'm not sure where I would be classified, as my back pain would grow and wane over the span of a decade. Fortunately I lucked out by finding an excellent physiotherapist who worked next to a kinesiologist. The physiotherapist identified weak muscles in my core and legs and provided me with exercises that focused on them, while the kinesiologist helped me figure out how and why I was moving around with poor posture. With their help I was able to virtually eliminate my back pain over the course of a year. In the past I had seen various other physiotherapists and religiously adhered to the different stretching and exercise regiments they would give me, but none of them really worked. I had weak stabilizer muscles and glutes, which general core exercises were ineffective in strengthening. I don't claim that exercise is a cure for all back pain, but I would be interested in seeing research on those for whom it does work.",54,1742388596.0,1jet0pz

mim937g,Fussel2107,"Christ this article is a mess. 

“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose [findings are published](https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/02/bmjebm-2024-112974) in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.

“The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain. Our review did not find reliable evidence of large effects for any of the included treatments.”

The one treatment that does help those with acute low-back pain is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they found. In addition, five treatments also bring some relief for chronic low-back pain: exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, [taping](https://www.neuromusculartaping.com/clarifying-the-differences-between-various-taping-techniques-in-rehabilitation-nmt/), antidepressants and what are known as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TPRV1) drugs.

But three treatments for acute back pain do not work – exercise, glucocortisoid injections and taking paracetamol. And two for chronic back pain are also ineffective – antibiotics and anaesthetics.

However, the evidence for the other 45 treatments is “inconclusive”. The researchers assessed and offered a judgement on the extent to which they all relieved pain. Despite some of them being very popular, most “may provide modest reductions in pain”, they said.

Interventions that “probably provide little to no difference in pain” include exercise, paracetamol, glucocortisoid injections, anaesthetics and antibiotics or antimicrobial drugs.

However, having a massage, taking painkillers and wearing foot orthotics “may provide” large reductions in pain.

Heat, acupuncture, spinal manipulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ([TENS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/)) may produce a “moderate” reduction in pain. Osteopathic treatment and using muscle relaxants and NSAIDs together may produce a small lessening of pain.

However, two treatments may increase someone’s pain, including extracorporeal shockwaves and the anti-inflammatory drug [colchicine](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/colchicine/).

min0xzy,nfshaw51,"As a practicing PT I feel like one of the most important things that can be done for acute back pain is fostering an understanding of the issue, surrounding factors, management strategies, and establishing a framework for recovery to normal function over time.  There can’t be a blanket for problem with so many variables, but those things are a strong start for most.

The reality is, like with many conservatively managed injuries, there is an unavoidable time-based element.  Your battle is often to take action to avoid detrimental circumstances that would lead to prolonging the pain, but there’s little that can be done to accelerate the healing process.  NSAIDs help with pain, sure, but they don’t accelerate tissue healing.  Movement can sometimes temporarily help with pain and mitigate atrophy, but again, doesn’t accelerate tissue healing.  It simply reduces the odds of delayed/impaired tissue healing or deleterious effects by disuse.

Promoting movement during the acute phase is less often about getting better faster (though I think you can maintain your functional ceiling a little better, and if you compared function at 4 weeks post-injury of someone who was minimal but appropriate activity vs someone who was moderate and appropriate activity, the moderate individual would likely be able to accomplish more at that interval - at 6 months, assuming both had self-resolving issues they’d likely end up in the same place - it’s whether or not the bit of gained function *despite continued pain* in the sub-acute phase is important is what matters for the exercise piece)

This is all said in the context of acute low back pain that can resolve via natural history, which is fairly common.  Appropriate, early mobilization, activity modification to reduce unnecessary insults to the healing tissue, and education foster better early function and avoiding lingering issues; it does not “fix” the damaged tissue and inflammatory process, your body ideally does that with time.

If the injury does not resolve/shows good indicators of improvement an appropriate time frame then it should absolutely be on to the next step.  I won’t go further into that because the can of worms that is involved with diagnostics, surgery/other invasive procedures, etc has been addressed in other comments - just to say, there’s a lot of advancement and improvement in the medical field to be made for those situations, we’re not very good at it yet (which is why it’s a big issue and warrants regular research, and why we can’t accurately distinguish whether or not many individuals need further intervention in the early phases without the initial conservative management time frame) though that doesn’t prevent good results from occurring.",4,1742400520.0,1jet0pz

The findings highlight the pandemic’s lasting impact on youth mental health.

The mental health of young people has long been a public health concern, with many disorders first appearing during childhood and adolescence. Mental disorders can affect cognitive development, school performance, relationships, and overall well-being, often carrying long-term consequences into adulthood. The COVID-19 pandemic created a new set of challenges that disrupted daily life, education, and social interactions, all of which are known to influence mental health.

Although previous research has examined the effects of the pandemic on mental health, there has been a lack of large-scale, globally representative studies specifically focused on children and adolescents. The authors of the new study sought to address this gap by using data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2021. They aimed to quantify changes in the prevalence and burden of mental disorders before and during the pandemic, providing a clearer picture of how young people were affected worldwide.

The researchers analyzed mental health data from 204 countries and territories, focusing on individuals aged 5 to 24. They examined three key measures: the number of new cases, the total number of people affected (prevalence), and the burden of mental disorders in terms of years lived with disability (YLDs).

minmems,Wagamaga,"For years, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been studied primarily in people who experience trauma firsthand. But what about those who witness it — military veterans, first responders, health care workers, or bystanders to violence — who constitute 10 percent of all PTSD cases?

New research from Virginia Tech, published in PLOS ONE, reveals that witnessing trauma triggers unique brain changes, distinct from those caused by experiencing trauma firsthand. The study is the first to shed light on the molecular differences between directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD and could pave the way for changes in how the disorders are treated. 

“Currently, patients with directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD are treated the same way – with a combination of therapy and medication,” said Timothy Jarome, the project’s principal investigator and associate professor of neurobiology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “Our research suggests that indirect trauma and direct trauma create different biological responses, which could mean they require different treatment strategies that target distinct brain pathways.”

https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/3/e091507

From the linked article: 

Eating more fruits, dietary fibre, dairy products and caffeine is linked to a lower risk of tinnitus (ringing in the ears), according to international researchers. To investigate the link between diet and the condition, the researchers combined the results of eight observational studies involving just over 300,000 people overall. Looking at 15 different dietary factors, the researchers say higher fruit intake was linked to a 35% reduction in tinnitus risk, dietary fibre a 9% reduction, dairy products a 17% reduction and caffeine a 10% reduction. They say their findings are based on a relatively small base of evidence and the studies they looked at can't prove these diet choices caused the participants' lower tinnitus risk, but their findings do support the theory that high-quality nutrients can help prevent ear and hearing damage.",4,1742385824.0,1jevd2b

While there may be no direct correlation mentioned in the study, in my experience it seems that lower income households tend to have less fresh fruit available on a regular basis. Whether that be because of food deserts in cities, lower income, higher prices of fresh fruit in general in certain areas, less education about nutrition within the demographic, or a combination of all of these things, I definitely would NOT rule out the bias that people keep mentioning. 

That being said, tinnitus can be caused by a variety of things, some including &/or related to nutritional deficits & hydration/electrolyte balance, so it still can mean that a diet higher in fresh fruits could help alleviate some of these issues. 

In short, the age old adage is true: You are what you eat. But it’s not at all your fault that the journey to health in this country seems to be paved in gold.

Not every ADHD/Autism diagnosis means that you can’t take care of yourself, however most people with these conditions do struggle with day-to-day life: getting dressed, working jobs, feeding themselves, and more important decompressing. 

Things like TikTok will only increase peoples openness to the diagnosis. When I was younger, ADHD was more misused then than now, especially whenever any child was just overtly misbehaving, it was often dubbed ADHD/ADD. Now, there is more discussion about it, and the content that I see on TikTok shows people that often those with disabilities look just like you. 

Now this might be a hot button topic, but the same exists for multiple smaller communities. For example, trans people getting more spotlight, and more attention, will only more likely lead to someone seeing themselves in those people and furthering their choice to seek an identity out. 

Without my late diagnosis, I would have continued to go throw life thinking something was wrong with me. Do I need help to live day to day, yes. If I don’t get that help will I be unable to take care of myself without it, probably not.

His story was that after taking it he was shocked that his mood improved, he was happy and chipper, and his work (doing large spreadsheets in excel) was engaging and enjoyable, when usually it is boring and tedious. He was diagnosing himself based on this experience. All the comments were celebrating him making this discovery and sharing stories about their first time on adderall and how much better they felt.

All the 'improvements' he felt from the adderall that he claimed was evidence of untreated ADHD is literally just the effects adderall has on human beings, ADHD or not.

A team led by researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada found that of the top 100 most-viewed TikTok videos tagged for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) content, fewer than half matched the professional diagnostic criteria for the condition.

The videos – which had collectively racked up nearly half a billion views in total – were largely based on personal experience and opinion. They often missed the nuances of ADHD, such as the way symptoms can differ between people.

""TikTok can be an incredible tool for raising awareness and reducing stigma, but it also has a downside,"" says UBC clinical psychologist Vasileia Karasavva.

Blaming influencers, the pandemic, or short attention spans is not targeting the root cause. The root cause is that we culturally refuse to acknowledge the over diagnosis and overmedication problem with the condition. It's not a problem unique to ASD either, but many mental health conditions.
  
When Asperger's was added to the DSM we saw the start of everyone claiming to have it and the colloquial definition expanding rapidly. They removed Asperger's and expanded ASD even more and now even more claim to have it and the definition colloquially expanded even further.
  
We culturally admitted to over prescribing opiates because people started getting addicted and overdosing in large numbers. ASD medication doesn't kill people so we haven't culturally admitted the same about the uppers prescribed to treat ASD.
  
It's a wildly nuanced topic because the things that brought this change aren't all bad and many were flatly good. 
  
Expanding diagnoses to adults was very good because tons of adults were never diagnosed as children and age doesn't magically remove ASD. However the reason they didn't use to diagnose adults was because it is very unreliable to diagnose many adults due to masking/coping behavior development and personality changes that come with aging. Opening that up means you'll get more diagnoses overall.
  
Expanding diagnoses criteria and adding the spectrum has the same good and bad effects. It both genuinely helps many people and causes more diagnoses overall.
  
The cultural perception shift towards accepting ASD and destigmatizing it is also extremely good, but has the comparitively minor downside of more people genuinely wanting the diagnoses which causes false-positives and even more diagnosed total.
  
Last part of the weirdly nuanced pie is that the uppers used to treat it are much safer than something like opiates and are abusable and beneficial to people with and without genuine ASD.
  
Personally I don't think the problem is necessarily a huge one, but it frustrates me that our healthcare system and drug companies get no flak for clearly pushing for over diagnosis and over medication. When the exact same players knowingly caused the opiate epidemic for profit.
  
If I had my druthers we'd adjust the DSM definition of ASD for adult diagnoses with more common sense, and legalize limited production and sale of uppers and downers both in some capacity. That could do wonders to help the US with overdose and addiction issues, and help to stabilize South and Central American countries by weakening their cartels.
  
Culturally we need to set a delineation between genetic and environmental causes for mental health issues. In many cases both are valid and real diagnoses, but we've landed in a place where everyone assumes their mental health issues are genetic and thus not improvable other than medication and we know that's simply not true for a lot of people. Drug companies love the fact that many people assume their issues require their drug so they've been pushing that angle as long as I've been alive.
  
It's okay to have depression, it's okay to take medication for it, it's less okay to assume your depression is genetic with no evidence, and it's less okay to assume your depression is treatment resistant when you haven't tried all treatments (including non-drug treatments).
  
It's okay to have ASD and get medication, but it's important to recognize that your medication helps people without ASD and to recognize that doctors have been taking bribes and pushing this medication for decades and that we're statistically in a state of over-diagnoses. If we're not in a state of over-diagnoses on ASD then we need to admit that we're diagnosing and medicating for a cultural problem and not just a bodily one, even if the bodily one does exist.",-7,1742562173.0,1jgef1q

mis6sun,chrisdh79,"From the article: A Norwegian man said he was horrified to discover that ChatGPT outputs had falsely accused him of murdering his own children.

According to a complaint filed Thursday by European Union digital rights advocates Noyb, Arve Hjalmar Holmen decided to see what information ChatGPT might provide if a user searched his name. He was shocked when ChatGPT responded with outputs falsely claiming that he was sentenced to 21 years in prison as ""a convicted criminal who murdered two of his children and attempted to murder his third son,"" a Noyb press release said.

ChatGPT's ""made-up horror story"" not only hallucinated events that never happened, but it also mixed ""clearly identifiable personal data""—such as the actual number and gender of Holmen's children and the name of his hometown—with the ""fake information,"" Noyb's press release said.

ChatGPT hallucinating a ""fake murderer and imprisonment"" while including ""real elements"" of the Norwegian man's ""personal life"" allegedly violated ""data accuracy"" requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), because Holmen allegedly could not easily correct the information, as the GDPR requires.

As Holmen saw it, his reputation remained on the line the longer the information was there, and—despite ""tiny"" disclaimers reminding ChatGPT users to verify outputs—there was no way to know how many people might have been exposed to the fake story and believed the information was accurate.",914,1742472701.0,1jfnf9y

miu6ohb,EmbarrassedHelp,"> In some cases, OpenAI filtered the model to avoid generating harmful outputs but likely didn't delete the false information from the training data, Noyb suggested. 

Does Noyb really think that there is text in the training data that explicitly says he murdered his kids? Or is that meant to be an attempt at getting access to the training dataset, and they are merely using this man to try and do that? Its obvious that model is simply drawing incorrect conclusions from the training data.

> ""Adding a disclaimer that you do not comply with the law does not make the law go away,"" Sardeli said. ""AI companies can also not just 'hide' false information from users while they internally still process false information. AI companies should stop acting as if the GDPR does not apply to them, when it clearly does. If hallucinations are not stopped, people can easily suffer reputational damage.""

If the information is filtered out internally, then I don't see the problem here? This seems more like an attempt to either ban LLMs or ensure that only the rich American tech companies can afford to run them in the EU.

mis519i,chrisdh79,"From the article: The latest victim of the Trump administration’s obsession with the appearance of efficiency is the guy who made the trains run on time. Stephen Gardner, the Chief Executive Officer of Amtrak who held the post since 2022, abruptly announced that he would be stepping down from his role Wednesday in the wake of Donald Trump and Elon Musk placing the train company in the crosshairs for potential privatization.

In a statement, Gardner said, “I am stepping down as CEO to ensure that Amtrak continues to enjoy the full faith and confidence of this administration.” Prior to taking the top role at the firm, he served as Amtrak’s chief operating and commercial officer starting in 2009 and as the organization’s president starting in 2020. And while he’s been hanging in the C-suite for a while now, Gardner has some pretty solid credentials as a train lover. He previously served as a conductor and operations manager for the Maine Central Railroad, and he founded a punk band called Chessie, which took its name from the defunct Chesapeake and Ohio Railway.

Despite this (or because of it), Gardner found himself between a rock and a hard place with the new administration. Trump’s ire for Amtrak isn’t new—new tried to cut federal funding for the company in half during his first administration—but it’s taken a sharper turn this time around. Billions of dollars of support for the railway got caught in Trump’s federal funding freeze earlier this year, and Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been pressing Amtrak to end diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and mandate return-to-office orders for employees or lose out on federal support.",65,1742471945.0,1jfn73i

“We have developed a comprehensive approach to help ensure the integrity of elections on our platforms: one that gives people a voice, supports participation in the civic process, and combats voter interference and foreign influence,” Meta’s head of policy in Australia, Cheryl Seeto, said in a blog explaining how the company is preparing for the country’s upcoming election. “We continue to work with Agence France-Presse (AFP) and the Australian Associated Press (AAP) to independently review content. We are also partnering with AAP on a new media literacy campaign to help Australians critically assess the content they view online, which will run in the lead-up to the election.”",17,1742485359.0,1jfrtmb

miuqkrh,charcoalist,"Meta intentionally promotes right-wing misinformation and media on their platforms (facebook, Instagram, Threads). After Zuckerberg visited trump at Mar a Lago this past November, he promoted Republican operative and DC insider Joel Kaplan to lead Global Policy at Meta. Meta then adjusted its algos to push right-wing content to the forefront, even if a user isn't subscribed to political content.

mizgipe,UCF_Official,"For people with upper extremity disabilities — such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis or other conditions — assistive robotics can help restore their independence in performing everyday tasks like eating, grooming and grasping objects. But much like old dogs, these devices have a hard time learning new tricks.

“They need a lot of demos to learn new tasks, and people with disabilities aren’t able to provide these demos,” says Professor Aman Behal, an assistive robotics expert at UCF. “If they can, they might not be the best demos for the robot to learn from.”

Behal aims to address this challenge with his new research project, Mobile Robot Manipulators for Learning and Executing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. The project is supported through a three-year, $600,000 grant from the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research.

Currently, mobile assistive robotics can be mounted to the side of a wheelchair or can trail behind the individual, ready to assist when needed. These devices allow users to navigate their homes or travel to places like an office or local park, offering greater flexibility than stationary fixed-base robotics.

While the dexterity of these robots allows them to assist with complex tasks like brushing hair or cutting a piece of steak, they can be difficult for the user to control or teach. Assistive robots perform tasks better over time by mimicking the user, but in these situations, the user may not be able to complete the task correctly — or at all.

Behal and his team of researchers, including Clinical Associate Professor of Physical Therapy Morris Beato, and Professor of Statistics and Data Science Edgard Maboudou, will create intelligent and mobile robotic assistants that offer easier control and a better robot-human interface.

The project’s first year will focus on research and development, while the second and third years will incorporate testing and user feedback. Initial testing  will be conducted with students, followed by studies involving adults with upper body paralysis.

“We will recruit adults between the ages of 18 and 65, bring them (into our lab) and essentially get the robots to do several tasks,” Behal says. “At the end of it, we’ll see how easy it was to interact with the robot.”

The researchers will survey the participants to find out how many times they had to tell the robot to perform a task, how long it took for the robot to complete the action, how many mistakes were made and how satisfied they were with the robot’s assistance.

The end goal is to develop smart robots that can give the user a greater degree of independence, leading to increased self-esteem and enhanced quality of life.",1,1742569416.0,1jgiwa7

mizrebh,chrisdh79,"From the article: A few years ago, the American automaker General Motors (GM) announced that it would be phasing out support for CarPlay and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform. It was a controversial decision, as many drivers who are in the market for a new vehicle consider CarPlay to be a must-have feature.

Looking to capitalize on the situation, one GM dealership near Detroit, Michigan last year began offering an aftermarket CarPlay installation service in GM’s newer EV models. But, according to a report this week from automotive blog The Drive (via The Verge), GM recently blocked the dealership from offering that service due to safety concerns.

“We have made the difficult decision to discontinue this product,” said the LaFontaine Chevrolet Plymouth dealership, on a website that previously offered the CarPlay installation service. “This was not a decision we made lightly, but due to a variety of factors, continuing to offer this product is no longer viable in the long term,” it said.

A spokesperson for GM told The Drive that unapproved aftermarket services “could affect critical safety features,” and pose other issues.

“Aftermarket services that introduce features not originally designed, thoroughly tested, and approved by GM may cause unintended issues for customers,” the GM spokesperson said, in response to this matter. “These issues could affect critical safety features and may also void portions of the vehicle’s warranty.”

It is unclear if the aftermarket CarPlay system actually poses any safety issues, or if GM is simply unhappy that one dealership decided to go against the company’s decision to focus on its own software platform. It is also unclear if customers who already had the installation service completed will be affected in any way.",1,1742572604.0,1jgk54d

misd0lt,s9oons,">”…previously articulated positions that suggest change could come to policy on four matters of interest to the tech community: Non-compete agreements; the right to repair; regulation of social media companies; and mergers”

I’m curious to see how they try to spin this as being good for the average American.

“Regulation of social media companies” just reads as we’re going to write legislation to only make it okay for fascist, sorry, republican propaganda to be posted on social media.


Non-compete agreements are a joke, and they’re required for a LOT of tech gigs. “Come work for us, but if we decide to fire you, with or without cause, you’re going to have to find a new industry to work in.” It’s so blatantly detrimental for employees and unnecessarily controlling by the companies.

Right to repair is the same thing as noncompete agreements. It ONLY benefits the manufacturers, not the customers. This one is especially big for farmers too, who can’t work on any of their John Deere (or is it Juan Deere now?) equipment if AND they can’t go to a 3rd party for repairs.

Deregulating mergers is, once again, ONLY good for businesses, not consumers. Consolidating already enormous businesses just gives consumers less choices and it gives the companies more of a monopoly.

Additionally 5 million tesla owners would not be able to receive updates and parts for their vehicles.  So you'd do very little to Elon while you would gravely impact millions of people who didn't cause this problem.  

This is also ignoring that he owns SpaceX which has locked in government contracts, so his wealth will not go away from protesting/vandalizing Teslas.  

The way to protest him would be by voting in the right candidates who can put a stop to this, not to ignore collateral damage while aiming at Tesla.  Alternatively, getting shareholders to pressure the company into making him step down would be another way to minimize his impact.

Trump is human trafficking people to a foreign prison for property damage while his own rabid, brain-dead cult tried to end democracy and walked free.

miy09j6,brain_overclocked,">Donald Trump’s interim Social Security chief suggested Thursday night he will effectively turn off the agency that manages the essential safety net program for seniors and the disabled, if Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) can’t access the non-anonymized sensitive personal information and data of hundreds of millions of Americans, based on a judge’s order.

>“My anti-fraud team would be DOGE affiliates. My IT staff would be DOGE affiliates,” said Lee Dudek, acting Social Security Administration (SSA) commissioner, arguing the order was too broad, according to Bloomberg News. “As it stands, I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems,” he said, adding: “Really, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency.”

>Dudek’s threat to block SSA employees from using the agency’s IT systems — a move that could halt Social Security payments — came in response to a judge’s temporary restraining order in a case brought by the AFL-CIO labor union. The order bars Social Security Administration officials from allowing DOGE, including Musk, and the SSA’s DOGE team to access personally identifiable information. It also directs Musk and DOGE to delete from their possession all non-anonymized personal data, and bars them from having access to SSA computers or code.

Calling their bluff on that one seems to be a no-brainer. Make them do it and let them face the fallout from it. Switching off Social Security payments is widely agreed to be a major red line from which everything will go downhill pretty damn quickly, so it'd be interesting to see if they have the courage of their conviction to actually go through with it. I don't think they will. Sure, Trump and Musk might be flying high on narcissism and/or ketamine right now, but at least some Republican lawmakers still have a bit of survival instinct left to see that if they stand by and let the White House outright kill their constituents, things might get ugly for them, regardless of how many millions Musk spends on the next election.",1,1742551859.0,1jgcgo5

I work with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Some people with IDD can get a job at the grocery store, but a lot of them have both intellectual and physical disabilities and there are simply no jobs that they can do, so they rely entirely on SSI. 

They need PCAs to take care of them, which Medicaid pays for. They have lots of medical care, which again, Medicaid pays for. 

Shutting down social security means these people will not be able to have PCAs to toilet them, bathe them, dress them, feed them, or do anything to make their lives enjoyable. What are they supposed to do? Many of them are quadriplegics with intellectual disabilities. They will lose their homes and their care and they will die.

miy79rj,TheRealJenneJ,"The issue here is that half the country thinks this is the way to achieve their end goal of less government intervention, which they believe hinders their pursuit of freedom. As a result of that belief, they support what the President is doing and welcome this change. They believe all these agencies getting ""gutted"" and dismantled is a good thing. They do not trust the Federal government to have their best interests in hand, and they want it all to be privatized. Even though private entities will never look out for the average American citizen in a world where they can profit off them instead.

This country, and likely all the world, is built on the backs of hard working people being manipulated by the rich. We have been here before. The rich and powerful people of this country have been working toward this time for about 80 years.  After the Civil War, the country was run by the robber barons of the railroad age, succeeded in the early twentieth century by the even greater barons of oil and banking. That's why the Federal government got so large and has so many departments and regulations. They were instituted in an attempt to protect the average American from the abuses of the rich and powerful. Under that system, the life of the average American got very cushy and America became the envy of the world as we became so fat and rich and happy.

All the while the contemporary ""robber barons"", those we now refer to as oligarchs, were getting more and more restricted and restrained. They were not fans of the restrictions placed on them by the federal government, and now they have organized and are taking back the power they believe has been rightfully theirs all along. The average American who supports this turn around believes they will also profit. They are wrong, of course, but we are going to have to travel a long way down this road before they recognize that and there are any serious calls for reform. It won't come easy.

*""Being willing to admit you're wrong is hard for most people.

Republicans have been swimming in decades of propaganda telling them liberals are the most loathsome people on the planet, making it all that much harder to admit that liberals were right all along. In addition, the personalities most attracted to Trumpism are hostile to critical thinking and attracted to ""my way or the highway"" attitudes that make no room to listen to disagreement.""*

...

*""There are plenty of people who can say, ""I was wrong"" or ""I'm sorry."" People who have that skill, however, tend to be empathetic, self-aware, and curious — all traits that prevent ever having voted for Trump in the first place.

miyekoi,Tiny-Western9010,"A lot of my friends voted for trump. One even voted for trump & is now somewhat distraught bc his girls brother in law is being deported. Good guy, hard workers too. I told him he voted for that, should have been no surprise & now you have to deal with selling out your friends families & neighbors for the possibility of a dollar going back into your pocket. He was obviously upset by my statement, but the truth usually stings. His response to all of this was “let’s just give it time, it’s only been a couple months” and that’s when I ended the convo. It’s ego. It’s embarrassment. It’s guilt they don’t want to face & admit to. They will not care until it’s directly affecting them & im sure with the more time we give this administration, a lot of those ego filled voters will feel the wrath that a lot of American citizens are feeling now. 

Trump voters are typically naive, for a nice way of putting it. I wouldn’t call them stupid bc they know what’s going on they’re just choosing to ignore it, for they know their hand played a part in everything going on. The only silver lining I can see in all of this is the possibility of trump supporters gaining some empathy the closer & closer this admin gets to negatively affects them & their livelihood directly.

I explained all the stupid shit and missteps. I just said ""Dude, if you accidentally shut down random power stations because you were trying to make the grid efficient, would you still have a job? What if you kept just fucking up because you can't just consult the actual workers?""

[Gerry Connolly ](https://thehill.com/people/gerry-connolly/)(D-Va.) requested an investigation into Commerce Secretary [Howard Lutnick’s ](https://thehill.com/people/howard-lutnick/)comments urging Americans to [buy Tesla stock](https://thehill.com/business/5204900-howard-lutnick-buy-tesla-stock/) as the company’s shares dip due to [mass firings](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5202655-elon-musk-life-in-danger-doge-fraud/) and reform efforts overseen by CEO Elon Musk. 

>“This is just the latest example of the Trump Administration using taxpayer resources to enrich the President’s inner circle,” Connolly wrote in a [Thursday letter](https://oversightdemocrats.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-oversight.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2025-03-20.gec-to-commerce-guenther-re-tesla-lutnick.pdf) to John K. Guenther, acting general counsel for the Department of Commerce.

>The Virginia lawmaker requested financial disclosures from Lutnick and his Deputy Secretary in addition to all political appointees, plus a copy of their electronic communications with the White House and correspondence between the White House Counsel, Office of Government Ethics, or Office of the Special Counsel and the Department of Commerce prior to his Fox interview.

>Connolly requested that Guenther present the information by April 3. 

>“The present circumstances differ in that Tesla is owned by an individual who has been given license by the President to slash and burn his way through the federal government, indiscriminately and lawlessly terminating federal workers and eliminating the services they provide to the American people, while lining his own pockets with billions of taxpayer dollars,” he wrote.

miy3gj6,blackopal2,"Elon Musk is wondering why people might not like him, so, I thought I would make a list he could review.  Hopefully,  for growth opportunities. 

Perceived Lack of Empathy: Musk's approach to business decisions, like mass layoffs at Tesla, Twitter, and now in federal agencies, often comes across as cold and indifferent. His focus on efficiency and innovation sometimes overshadows the human cost of his actions.

Social Media Behavior: Musk's tweets and public statements can be provocative, controversial, or even dismissive. His willingness to make off-the-cuff remarks or jokes on serious topics (like the nuclear bombings of Japan) can alienate people who expect a more thoughtful approach.

Political Alignments: Musk’s growing alignment with conservative and libertarian viewpoints, especially his support of Trump and involvement in government restructuring, has polarized audiences who once saw him as a visionary tech leader.

Perceived Hypocrisy: While advocating for free speech and innovation, he has sometimes been accused of suppressing dissent at his companies and promoting views that contradict his previously progressive image.

Labor Practices and Worker Treatment: Musk’s opposition to unions and reports of poor working conditions at Tesla and SpaceX have fueled resentment, particularly among those who value labor rights.

Dismissive Comments on Important Issues: Whether it’s downplaying the pandemic or making light of nuclear disasters, Musk’s remarks can come across as insensitive and out of touch.

Privileged Perspective: As one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, Musk sometimes appears detached from the struggles of average people, especially when he frames massive layoffs as necessary ""efficiency"" improvements.

If Musk wants to change public perception, showing more empathy, acknowledging the human impact of his decisions, and engaging in more thoughtful, less provocative communication would likely help. Balancing innovation with compassion could bridge the gap between his vision and how people perceive him.",1,1742549849.0,1jg5q27

Many people went through school themselves, so they assume they fully understand the content knowledge and pedagogical demands of being a teacher.

> To avoid the consequences of Trump’s order, the White House said, the firm had agreed to “take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society”.

Minnesota state Senator Justin Eichorn resigned from jail on Thursday after being arrested earlier this week on charges of arranging to solicit a minor for prostitution.

The MAGA Republican was arrested on Monday after being caught in a sting operation orchestrated by Bloomington Police. According to law enforcement in the Minneapolis suburb, Eichorn attempted to orchestrate a meeting with what he thought was a 17-year-old girl but was really a detective and was arrested “without incident” when he arrived at the proposed location.

This is Trump's pitch to the country on why he should have unlimited power. That because he won a national election, he should be allowed to do whatever he wants as long as he says it's for the good of the country. And this mentality not only might get popular, but it's been a long time coming.

When you give the general population a choice on the one person to be in the highest office in the country, and that person becomes the face of their political party, the belief will eventually form that the power is a top-down structure starting with that one person. The system might officially be three co-equal branches, but the people won't see it that way. They'll believe that the politician who needs the whole country to vote for them is more powerful than the collection of politicians that only need to win their district, or the judges that don't need to win any election.

In short, they see the presidential election as the election of a temporary monarch, not the leader of a co-equal branch of government. Congress and the judiciary are seen by them not as checks and balances, but the lackeys who help to fulfill the president's agenda. Trump certainly sees it that way, considering he sees those checks and balances as attempts to usurp power.

The political situation we're in right now is the result of decades of rhetoric meeting its logical conclusion: That the country famous for gaining it's independence by defying a king is begging the government to get out of the way to make room for their *new* king.",1,1742573837.0,1jgedy7

mivmoha,T_Shurt,"As per [original article](https://people.com/trump-admin-publishes-ssns-living-people-unredacted-jfk-files-11700615) 📰:

- The newly unsealed files have not yet produced revelations about the assassination itself. 

Social Security numbers and other private information belonging to hundreds of Americans — some of whom are still living — were made public as President Donald Trump’s administration released more than 60,000 pages of unredacted documents pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

Both The New York Times and the The Washington Post report that the personal information — including Social Security numbers of congressional staff members, intelligence researchers and others — was made public on Tuesday, March 18, along with their corresponding files on the 1963 assassination.

Former Trump campaign lawyer Joseph diGenova, whose information was apparently part of the release, told the Post that the move was “absolutely outrageous” as well as “sloppy” and “unprofessional.”

“It not only means identity theft, but I’ve had threats against me,” said diGenova. “In the past, I’ve had to report real threats against me to the FBI. There are dangerous nuts out there.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, per the Times, that the Trump administration is aware that it released personal information of former government employees and that the National Archives and the Social Security Administration “immediately put together an action plan to proactively help individuals whose personal information was released in the files.”

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Thursday, March 20.

The release of the documents on March 18 — 64,000 of the 80,000 total pages Trump had promised — came just one day after the president vowed to release all the remaining assassination files during a Monday visit to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.

A person with knowledge of the documents’ release told the Times that officials knew releasing them without redactions would lead to the publishing of Americans’ personal information. Journalists and historians sifting through the document drop have so far failed to uncover any major new revelations about the assassination itself.

William Harnage, a former government contractor, told the Times that he considered the release of his information “almost criminal.” Harnage said he learned from a reporter that his Social Security number from a 1977 file had been made public.

According to the Post, among the information made public was the personal information of some former staffers of the Church Committee — a group that identified abuses by the CIA, FBI, Internal Revenue Service and multiple other agencies. Some of those people have since frozen their bank accounts and credit cards after being contacted by reporters this week.

“It just shows the danger of how this administration is handling these things with no thought of who gets damaged in the process,” a former staffer of the Church Committee told the newspaper.

“It seems like the damage is done, but clearly we have to talk to some lawyers,” the staffer added.

Judy K. Barga, a former government contractor who still supports Trump overall, told the Times that the release of her personal information was “not good for anybody.”

“People’s private information should be kept private,” she said.

As previously reported, the release of the files pertaining to the death of Kennedy — who was fatally shot during a Dallas motorcade in November 1963 — was teased during Trump’s first term, before former President Joe Biden took limited action by releasing some.

Trump has also ordered the release of files pertaining to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Jack Schlossberg — the only grandson of JFK — has repeatedly slammed Trump for pushing to declassify the remaining assassination files, which historians and insiders have long warned were unlikely to reveal anything surprising or validate conspiracy theories, given that the most substantial files were already public.

“The truth is [a lot] sadder than the myth — a tragedy that didn’t need to happen,” Schlossberg wrote in a Jan. 23 post to X, which he shared on Instagram later that day. “Not part of an inevitable grand scheme.”

He added, “Declassification is using JFK as a political prop, when he’s not here to punch back. There’s nothing heroic about it.”",199,1742510433.0,1jg1ttm

If Chief Justice Roberts and the SCOTUS conservative majority had any sense of self-preservation (or even the slightest respect for the rule of law), they'd reverse two disastrous rulings: 1) expanding presidential immunity for Trump and 2) failing to uphold Colorado’s ruling disqualifying him from office as an adjudicated insurrectionist.

The 14th Amendment, Section 3, is self-executing, and the Court could affirm this in their ruling, making it clear that any orders from Trump to block his removal will be considered contempt of SCOTUS. This includes any attempts by him to direct federal agencies like the DOJ, FBI, or U.S. Marshals to interfere with his removal or arrest.

* Hageman — who ousted incumbent [Liz Cheney](https://people.com/liz-cheney-asks-americans-to-be-guardrails-of-democracy-following-election-8740583) in a landslide victory in the 2022 election for the state’s only congressional district — laughed aloud during the public event as a crowd of frustrated Wyomingites booed her praise for President Donald Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.
* “I voted in favor of the continuing resolution, or CR, which extends funding for the fiscal year until September 30,” Hageman said, prompting the booing to begin. “It keeps the lights on for President Trump and DOGE to continue their work.”",1,1742572498.0,1jgk3si

No matter how many thousands of federal employees they fire, it won’t be enough to pay for Trump’s rich tax cuts. She hasn’t seen anything yet. Wait until Republicans make cuts to entitlements to pay for those rich tax cuts, or as Elon called Social Security, a Ponzi scheme.

yes, politicians have a task to do what is nessecary. But ultimately...the power comes from the ppl.

politicians are always ever just a product of their societies. And that is what you see mirrored in Washington. A few super rich actors full of energy and ambition. And a vast emptiness of ppl without imagination or ideas or principles to hold on to. it is just a huge confused mass of ppl that face dictarorship....and in parts are so badly edcuated they don't realize it because they do not even know what ""democracy"" means.

miv6bon,dblan9,">ICE’s accusations were based on two things. First, Barrios has a tattoo on his arm of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball that, federal immigration authorities allege, “is proof of gang membership.” In reality, Tobin wrote, the tattoo was inspired by the Real Madrid soccer team, which is also circular in shape and features a crown. Second, Barrios posted a photo of himself on social media in which he’s gesturing with both hands, with his middle fingers down. This, federal agents claimed, was also proof of gang membership—except that Barrios’ hand gesture actually means “I love you” in sign language and is also commonly used as a symbol of rock ’n’ roll.

Key takeaways:

* Ukrainian forces conducted a drone strike against Engels Airbase in Saratov Oblast on the night of March 19 to 20.
* Russia, Ukraine, and the United States have not yet concluded the details of the moratorium against energy infrastructure strikes. The Ukrainian strike against Engels Airbase would not have been subject to this moratorium in any event because it is a military target.
* The Kremlin announced that Russia and the United States will hold another round of talks in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia on March 24, and it is unclear whether these talks will include Ukraine.
* Kremlin officials continue to amplify narratives indicating that Russian President Vladimir Putin remains committed to his long-standing goals of conquering Ukraine and is attempting to leverage upcoming ceasefire negotiations to secure preemptive concessions from Ukraine and the United States.
* Kremlin officials are also working to exacerbate tension between the United States and its European allies in order to break Western support for Ukraine and undermine the NATO alliance.
* Putin continues to condition domestic Russian audiences to prepare for a protracted war in Ukraine rather than a sustainable peace built on compromise.
* The Kremlin is intensifying efforts to change the demographic makeup of occupied Ukraine in order to legitimize Putin's claim over occupied areas.
* The Kremlin also continues Russifying Ukrainian children in occupied areas to further the destruction of Ukrainian national and cultural identity and to portray Russia as the humane governor of occupied Ukraine.
* Kremlin officials continue advertising the possibility of future economic cooperation with the United States, likely to extract preemptive concessions from the United States in ceasefire or peace negotiations.
* Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump spoke about investments in Ukraine's energy infrastructure during their call on March 19.
* US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce condemned North Korea's involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine on March 19 and expressed concern about Russian support to North Korea.
* Ukraine’s allies continue to provide financial and material military assistance to Ukraine, including funds from frozen Russian assets in Europe.
* Ukrainian forces recently advanced in Belgorod Oblast and Russian forces recently advanced in Kursk Oblast and near Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and Velyka Novosilka
* Russia may extend military veteran status to Russian milbloggers and military correspondents covering the war in Ukraine, likely in an effort to further coopt and appease the Russian ultranationalist milblogger community.",46,1742542107.0,1jg8a5a

Ground robotic complexes, heavily used by Ukraine’s Third Assault Brigade, are saving soldiers’ lives by handling dangerous logistics tasks, Deputy Commander Maksym Zhorin said on Radio NV on March 20.

""The experience of the Third Assault Brigade shows that, as of today, the GRCs (ground robotic systems - ed.) are a bit of an underrated story,"" he said.

“And today, 60% of the GRCs used in the army are used by the Third Assault Brigade.”

The brigade deploys these robots primarily to protect troops by taking over logistics and evacuation duties in high-risk zones. 

“Where it’s most dangerous today, like getting to and from positions, is riskier than staying put,” Zhorin added.

“It’s safer for an infantryman on the line than making that trip once either way. We’re shifting this to drones and platforms, and GRCs will be part of the unmanned units in the new corps.”

At a European Council summit in Brussels on Thursday, March 20, EU leaders failed to reach an agreement on allocating €5 billion for the purchase of 2 million artillery shells for Ukraine this year. According to Bloomberg, several countries – including France and Italy – refused to commit to specific financial contributions.

France and Italy believe the initiative is still insufficiently developed and are requesting more technical and financial details.

French diplomats stated that while they support the goals of the initiative, their priority is the EU’s €18 billion contribution to the G7 loan package for Ukraine.

According to Bloomberg, France and Italy – the EU’s two largest economies after Germany – are reluctant to publicly disclose how much they are willing to provide, especially when large sums are involved.

Earlier this year, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Kaja Kallas, proposed that EU countries provide up to €40 billion in military aid to Ukraine in 2025. The aid would be voluntary – either in cash or equipment. However, after several countries raised objections, this week’s discussions were narrowed to focus solely on the ammunition component.

Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo advocated for the initiative and complained about the resistance it faced from some EU capitals. Many countries are not “performing adequately” when it comes to arms deliveries to Ukraine, he said.

At the same time, others criticized the approach of setting contribution figures too early, before securing the countries’ agreement to participate.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said setting numbers first “was done backwards.”

“It may create an impression that someone doesn’t do enough – but readiness to support Ukraine is there, even if it is difficult to quantify it now,” Nausėda told reporters.

Linked by video to the summit in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on EU leaders to urgently provide €5 billion for artillery shells for Ukraine. Kaja Kallas had previously put forward a similar initiative.

Zelensky made an urgent plea for the sum to purchase ammunition “as soon as possible,” making reference to a massive overnight drone strike over Ukraine as the war drags on.

“It’s crucial that your support for Ukraine doesn’t decrease but instead continues and grows,” Zelensky said. “And this is especially true for air defense, military aid, and our overall resilience.”",21,1742558043.0,1jg8a5a

French developer Elwave will deploy its Tetrapulse sensor for Ukraine’s underwater mine countermeasure operations.

The technology is based on the company’s flagship Controlled Electric Detection And Ranging (CEDAR) solution, which supports the detection of metallic and non-metallic mines as well as ammunition planted in low visibility areas or deeper.

Once fielded, the Tetrapulse is expected to sustain continuous anti-mine operability in domains where traditional magnetometer, acoustic, and video-based systems are ineffective.

Elwave noted the anti-mine sensor for war-torn Ukraine will aid the country in securing its waterways and harbors.

Furthermore, the equipment will assist the government in reviving its “essential economic activities.”

“The selection of Tetrapulse for this critical mission by demining and [unexploded ordnance] specialists underscores their confidence in our technology and its operational readiness,” Naval News reported, citing Elwave CEO Pierre Tuffigo.

“We are honored to be part of this effort and look forward to delivering tangible benefits where they are needed most.”

Elwave’s announcement follows its partnership with Paris-based defense contractor Exail to integrate the Tetrapulse into the latter’s proprietary R7 remotely operated vehicle.

The partnership stems from Exail’s decision to improve the underwater drone’s ability to track materials made of aluminum, steel, and fiberglass composites.

Exail’s R7 features a five-function arm to handle or transport articles. The vehicle can dive up to 300 meters (984 feet), travel at speeds of 3 knots (3.4 miles/5.5 kilometers per hour), and carry objects weighing up to 35 kilograms (77 pounds).",1,1742570908.0,1jg8a5a

[It's been reported](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/marco-rubio-state-transgender-visa-b2704734.html) that the US government is looking to implement a policy where if a foreign trans person has a sex marker on their visa or passport that differs from their sex assigned at birth, they can be detained for visa fraud. No trans person should feel safe visiting the US anymore.

- illegally breaking into agencies even not under their jurisdiction while brandishing guns to raid their computers

- arresting cybersecurity officers and staff trying to stop the raids 

- firing highly placed women and non-whites in government positions without cause,

- refusing to give names and badge numbers as they arrest and isolate people with no criminal record for disagreeing with the President

- sending people off without any legal hearing to foreign prisons and refusing to give details even to a judge

- making older people worry if they will ever see their next Social Security check

- letting hackers install programs and steal data on confidential government computers without any vetting or security clearance

- threatening to invade and take over Canada and Greenland

I just wish we didn’t cock it up so bad, so fast, that we are now looking like we did a 180, and want to be friends with the evil in the world. The dictators, mainly Russia and North Korea, who fund and support terrorist groups around the world. These same terrorist groups who have been fighting against and killing our militaries for the past two decades. 

I remember when we use to be great, a few months ago. I hope we can get things right sooner than 4 years. I hate watching our countries status in this world, our economy, our partnerships burn all because we elected the wrong person… again. 

We, Americans, only have ourselves to blame.

He’s reaching out to countries I wouldn’t have expected, each of which holds more strategic weight than it seems at first glance.

One is home to an autonomous region he’s openly said he wants to annex. Another sits squarely in the path of where Putin’s ambitions have been inching. And the third? Right on Russia’s northern border, perfectly positioned for any hypothetical push toward St. Petersburg. If a wider conflict were to erupt, that territory would be crucial to secure immediately.

In fact, when you look at a map, you’ve got Finland, Lithuania, and Estonia, surrounding the Russian end of the Baltics, Denmark at its entrance. The inner perfectly placed for a drive toward St. Petersburg, and deeper into Russia beyond that. Is this about reclaiming “NATO lake”? Securing St Petersburg? Something else entirely?

Trump’s exactly the type to say “fuck it” and ignore the bird flu entirely if it meant driving prices down at home. Optics have always mattered more to him than outcomes. I just don’t buy the idea that he’d willingly go begging to Europe, it makes him, and by extension the US, look weak. He let hundreds of thousands die through sheer negligence during COVID.

He has also announced an unprecedented inspection and digitisation of the vaccination records of all children in Poland.

>The developments come after an unvaccinated child was admitted to hospital in Wrocław this month with diptheria, a disease that it is obligatory in Poland to vaccinate against. Recent years have, however, seen a rapid growth in the number of parents refusing to vaccinate their children.

>This is “the first case of severe diphtheria in an unvaccinated child in many years in Poland”, said Grzesiowski at a press conference on Tuesday. He noted that the six-year-old child had developed the illness after returning from Africa.

>Diphtheria can often be fatal in young children. The infected child in Wrocław remains in serious condition, with Grzesiowski revealing that he has been placed into an induced coma. An adult who had close contact with the child has also been hospitalised with a milder case of the disease.

>

>In an interview with broadcaster TVN on Thursday, Grzesiowski argued that action needs to be taken to ensure that parents comply with the requirement to give their children mandatory vaccinations.

>He noted that currently, although parents can in theory be fined for failing to do so, the legal process can “last several years and it does not work”. Parents are able to “not vaccinate their child and not have any major problems because of it”.

>To improve the situation, “we would have to change the entire system, rebuilding it in such a way that an unvaccinated child would have to have difficult access to various elements of social life, such as preschool or school or any other where a large group could be infected”, said Grzesiowski.

>

>But he admitted that this would be difficult “because in the Polish legal system everyone has the right to use preschool or school – this is guaranteed by the constitution – so there are no simple solutions here”.

>Article 70 of Poland’s constitution states that: “Everyone shall have the right to education. Education to 18 years of age shall be compulsory.” Some lawmakers have previously proposed banning unvaccinated children from nurseries and preschools, a measure already implemented by a handful of local authorities.

>Speaking to TVN, Grzesiowski said that any such measures would not be about depriving children of education but of deciding how that education takes place. “Can a child take part in group glasses or will they have to have an individual course of care or education,” he said.",1,1742573124.0,1jggezl

>Bejda said Poland had “no choice” but to withdraw from the convention as his country faced a “very real and very serious threat” at its frontiers with Belarus and Russia. 

>He added that bolstering defenses was part of Warsaw’s ‘Eastern Shield’ project to reinforce its section of NATO’s eastern flank. 

>In an interview with the RMF24 news site on Tuesday, Bejda said Poland does not currently have anti-personnel mines but has the capacity to produce them.  

>He said mine production would be undertaken by both state-owned and private defense contractors, adding that the production potential needs to be boosted. 

>He added that state-owned arms producer PGZ would be involved in a drive to produce “several hundred thousand, we can say a million” anti-personnel mines, and that this would take eight or nine months. 

>Prices have been rising quickly across the Russian economy for months, pushed up by massive government spending on the Ukraine conflict and deep labour shortages.

>Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz has said withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention will have to be approved by the country’s Cabinet, parliament and president, and end with a notification to the United Nations, following which the procedure could take around six months, the Defense News website reported. ",3,1742562247.0,1jgdg25

Well, these people are older now, they have years of experience running research programs and labs, and often they're nostalgic for their old home.  

It's the perfect time to recruit them back.  China's been doing this for years now because they know science is what gets you to the top.  This compounds as well because these older scientists can use their experience to build up good research programs to a degree that fewer and fewer students need to go to the US for a top-notch education, which means we get less and less chance at seeing top talent come and stay in the US.

The Kremlin's native language is violence. Violence is something that they use and understand. The ""guy falling out of windows"" and ""polonium tea"" incidents aren't simply revenge; that's how the Kremlin _speaks_. It is their form of communication.

_NOTHING_ Russia _says_ has any meaning except as indicator who and how they want to deceive. The only thing that we should pay attention to is what they _do_.

By all means, he and this trio of ""loose ends"" are in fact, weak, and by all means, they should be driven out of power by the people they intended to subjugate.

The exact text of the ""warning"" is:

> You should comply with all entry, visa and other conditions of entry. The authorities in the US set and enforce entry rules strictly. You may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the [US Embassy or a consulate in the UK](https://uk.usembassy.gov/).

From this page: https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/usa/entry-requirements

I am almost certain that this is the same wording which has been in place for the USA travel guidance for many years, and it doesn't represent any change in official travel advisory status for UK citizens entering the USA.

EDIT: per u/DisillusionedExLib there has been a change in wording in this paragraph which draws attention to the fact that enforcement of the rules around entry to the US is being enforced more aggressively, but that isn't the same as [an FCDO advice notice to avoid all but essential travel or to avoid all travel](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-foreign-commonwealth-development-office-travel-advice).

The more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly.

>__The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) is changing its asylum policy for men from Afghanistan. Single men with rejected asylum applications can now be deported to Afghanistan under certain circumstances.__

>In certain cases, a return to Afghanistan is reasonable, the SEM announced on Thursday. The SEM is basing this adjustment to its deportation policy on current situation analyses. According to these analyses, the security situation has improved significantly compared to the time when the radical Islamist Taliban took power. The analyses also attested to a slight improvement in the socio-economic situation.

>The State Secretariat still assumes that deportation to a state ruled by the radical Islamist Taliban is generally unreasonable. However, deportation is possible for non-vulnerable men if there are “favourable factors”.

>According to the SEM, this means that a rejected asylum seeker is living in Switzerland without family, is healthy and of legal age. In addition, there must be a stable and viable network of relationships in Afghanistan on which a returned asylum seeker can rely for social and professional reintegration.

>Women, families, minors and people with health problems are not affected by repatriations, as the SEM goes on to say.

While they have production capacity and technology to manufacture weapons for self defense, they also need are partners, and of course funds, and they're looking for both at the moment. So far, the European Union has sought non EU countries like UK, Norway, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Ukraine to be potential associates. Perhaps Taiwan could take advantage of this, and enter this ""partnership"" market. 

For example, even just provide, rather sell production licenses and some tech for example, for their air defense systems like the Sky Sword and of course the Sky Bow-3. The latter claims to have anti ballistic missile capabilities, meaning potentially one of the few outside of the US (ex. (1) Arrow 3 from Israel, + Germany (2) South Korea's L-SAM and (3) Europe's MBDA & Thales's SAMP/T). Perhaps for security purposes, even just an ""export version"" of the Sky Bow-3 could maybe viable? For example the Sky Bow-3 has a range of 200 km, reduce it to 150 km. While not battle tested like the Patriots or even the SAMP/T, Europe has at least another anti ballistic missile system on hand and according to their discretion could modify, even improve it themselves. On top of that, Taiwan's superconductors and micro chips can always be in high demand, especially in Europe, especially now that they're trying to wake up their tech and cyber industry, for example, for more advanced weapons and telecommunication systems.  

By selling these commodities (Export version Air Defense systems production licenses, micro chip and superconductors etc.) to Europe, Taiwan can use this to request purchase of more advanced European military hardware and equipment. Fighter jets like the Rafale or even the Eurofighter Typhoon, as well as IFVs and APCs (Patria, Boxer, Lynx, etc.) plus drones (FPVs, for example), ATGMs (Spike, Brimstone, MILAN, NLAWs, etc), even artillery (Caesar, RCH, Archer, etc.).  Perhaps even requesting European naval presence and guarantees.

miynzfi,zorionek0,"> Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything.

>“Are you feeling all right?” I asked her.

>“I feel all sleepy,” she said.

>In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.

>The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. That was twenty-four years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.

>On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunized against measles. I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.

>It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion, parents who now refuse to have their children immunized are putting the lives of those children at risk. In America, where measles immunization is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.

>Here in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunized, we still have a hundred thousand cases of measles every year. Out of those, more than 10,000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another. At least 10,000 will develop ear or chest infections. About 20 will die.

>LET THAT SINK IN.

>Every year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.

>So what about the risks that your children will run from being immunized?

>They are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300,000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunization! That is about a million to one chance. I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunization.

>So what on earth are you worrying about? It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunized.

>The ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunization should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible.

>Incidentally, I dedicated two of my books to Olivia, the first was ‘James and the Giant Peach‘. That was when she was still alive. The second was ‘The BFG‘, dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles. You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children

Then the reality set in. I kept trying to push through the inconveniences but damned if they didn’t add up quickly. To whit:

1.) A software update meant to improve the positional accuracy of the map bricked - get this - the A/C system. In the summer. It was literally a guessing game whether the A/C would turn on when I got in the car. Persisted for about 3 months before a patch was rolled out.

2.) The vaunted heat pump quit twice, once in winter (as we were moving across the country). Only a threat of litigation got the service center to replace the unit. Replacing it took the service center nearly a week.

3.) A simple windshield replacement was needed after a rock caused a crack that started spreading. I scheduled service (soonest I could get a spot was 4 weeks out) which got delayed an additional whole month because “Our glass guy is sick,” and yet another whole month because “We don’t have glass.”

4.) At 4 years of ownership, it was found that elements of the sub-frame were developing soon-to-be catastrophic cracks. No, I didn’t rally race it. Yes, I was religious about washing road salt off of it in wintertime. The upper control arm bushing was also “shredded” according to Firestone.

After #4 happened, I drove to a dealership that literal same day and traded it in.",470,1742556679.0,1jge5rg

miv9g35,Nythoren,"They also immediately walked it back.  The EO is red meat for the GOP base, but not even Trump thought it would actually happen. 

While the headlines and Trump's words say ""they're shutting down the Department of Education!"" the actual actions are: they're reducing the number of Department of Education employees by 50%.  The department will continue to service student loan, issue Pell grants, enforcement of civil rights laws, Title I (funds for school children with disabilities) and all the other legally mandated services the Department of Education provides.  

The GOP is introducing legislation to try to dissolve the department, but it requires 60 votes in the Senate to accomplish, which isn't going to happen.  Most of the GOP wants to keep the Department of Education alive because it's the only thing keeping a lot of red state school systems afloat.  Mississippi, for example, would need to raise taxes by roughly $2000/year for each person in the state with a full time job in order to make up for the funding that would be lost if the Department of Education ceased to exist.  They don't WANT the bill to pass, but they're all going to vote for it because they know the Democrats won't let it happen.  

This is one of the GOP's classic performative headline stealing actions.  Don't be distracted, keep watching the real stuff that's going on that needs to be stopped.  Keep screaming about the administration blatantly disobeying the Judicial Branch.  Pay attention to ICE disappearing people who are in the country legally.

The sheriff system is deeply flawed as they are elected at the county level and more or less only accountable to the voters at election time. There’s little institutional force to hold them accountable to any standard and stories of sheriff department abuses are so common it borders on cliche. 

So we have a sheriffs department in a deeply conservative and rural area, accountable to almost no one, parroting myths about drugs coming over the border from Canada and harassing two well meaning talented artists.

HOLY FUCK? HOLY FUCK?????? FUCK!!

I'm a trans person, and I've been scared that they're gonna just start saying we're a national security threat and sending us to El Salvador, too. Not that sending people there for being brown is any reason to do it, either. But I kind of thought, like, no way, yk, I've got this family and friend group that adores me, they'd fight tooth and nail to see me returned home, and unlike the Jews in Nazi Germany they can't send my entire family since I'm the only trans person.

But *that doesn't matter*

They can just whisk you away to a prison in another country with no due process and not even any charges, and then your loved ones go dark, and there's jack shit they can do.

Also, like, the article says he was ""deported"" to El Salvador. He was not ""deported"". Deporting would mean he would be sent back to Venezuela. He was extradited to another country where he has never been and that also has no arrest warrant, and sent to a maximum security prison. He was sent to an overseas detention camp.

Why, if they truly just want to deport people, are they not sending them to their home countries? Are they not even, like, just dropping them off in Mexico? Why do they need to take them to these prisons? What is the purpose? Is it just so they can do some sort of money scheme?",87,1742496384.0,1jft0rg

mius1ro,Riakrus," Trump has repeatedly labeled those who challenge him—journalists, political opponents, and even everyday protesters—as “terrorists” or “enemies of the state.” This tactic is not just reckless rhetoric; it’s a direct threat to the foundation of our democracy.

If it can be done to American citizens, it can be done to any of us—left, right, MAGA, progressive—any American. If you cross the wrong person, if you speak out, if you don’t fall in line, suddenly you could be labeled an enemy.

If you believe in free speech, think about this—someone in power could decide you are a threat, strip you of your rights, and punish you without due process. And worse? There will be people cheering it on.

Were some of these people bad actors? Maybe. But without due process, how the hell would we know? That’s the point. We all need to wake up and let that sink in.

Here are just a few examples of Trump’s use of this dangerous strategy:
	•	Attacking the Media: Trump has repeatedly called the press “the enemy of the people.” In March 2025, he went further, suggesting that outlets like CNN and MSNBC should be investigated for their coverage. (The Guardian)
	•	Targeting Political Opponents: In October 2024, Trump suggested using the U.S. military against political adversaries, branding them as “the enemy within.” Congressman Adam Schiff was among those singled out. (The Guardian)
	•	Condemning Protesters: During the George Floyd protests, Trump shared a letter referring to demonstrators as “terrorists,” justifying heavy-handed crackdowns. (Wikipedia)
	•	Selective Use of ‘Terrorism’: In March 2025, Trump called vandalism at Tesla dealerships “domestic terrorism,” vowing harsh penalties, showing how he weaponizes this term based on personal interests. (Reuters)

This is bigger than one politician. When a leader starts using terms like “terrorist” to silence opposition, democracy itself is at risk. This is a wake-up call for all Americans—because next time, it could be you.",14,1742501199.0,1jft0rg

I'm curious to know how exactly that these people discovered that the Herpes and Hepatitis-A that they contracted was from tainted urine water that they contacted through a dirty water bottle at work? 

Moreover, how did they discover that the janitor was pissing in bottles?

By the sounds of it, this creepy criminal got away with his sick crime for long enough to infect multiple poor victims who unknowingly drank the tainted urine water. Seems like they would have waited for enough time to contract the symptoms of these STD’s, which is usually more than a day or two.

My immediate assumption is that they all contracted herpes through some type of contact tracing.   But how did they determine their outbreak was connected to their co-workers and specifically to the water at work?

Maybe the poor victim tasted the tainted water right away?  

If that’s the case then how did so many people try the water that more than one would be contaminated with the STD’s?

Maybe they had a suspicion and checked cameras?  Maybe he told someone and they ratted him out?  

I can’t imagine contracting herpes, but if I did in a marriage, I can assume I sould naturally pass it to my partner, and each partner would think the other is unfaithful. Not that I would assume my partner was cheating on me but for some reason it seems more likely to assume than a situation like this.  I would never immidiately assume someone pissed in my water at work and gave me herpes.

That being said, I probably wouldn't be going to work and telling people I had herpes and my wife is potentially cheating on me.  That brings me back in a circle to the beginning, how did they all determine they all got herpes from an unknown source?

The mechanics of this situation are weird.   Just weird.

>**Researchers say that beyond health and wealth, some factors that influence happiness sound deceptively simple: sharing meals with others, having somebody to count on for social support, and household size**. In Mexico and Europe, for example, a household size of four to five people predicts the highest levels of happiness, the study said.

>**Believing in the kindness of others is also much more closely tied to happiness than previously thought**, according to the latest findings.

>As an example, the report suggests that **people who believe that others are willing to return their lost wallet is a strong predictor of the overall happiness of a population**.

>Nordic nations rank among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the study found.

>Overall, researchers said **global evidence on the perceived and actual return of lost wallets shows that people are much too pessimistic about the kindness of their communities compared to reality** — actual rates of wallet return are around twice as high as people expect.

>...

>Experts in economics, psychology, sociology and beyond then seek to explain the variations across countries and over time using factors such as **GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, a sense of freedom, generosity and perceptions of corruption**.

It's a good reminder that a sense of community, personal relationships, and social solidarity add real value to people's lives.

The label comes from its eerie symptoms, drooling, vacant stares, dramatic weight loss and animals staggering around in a disoriented daze. But scientists say the nickname is misleading and dangerously trivialises what could turn into a global crisis.

CWD is always fatal and has no cure. First detected in wild deer in Colorado and Wyoming in 1981, it has since spread across 36 American states and beyond, reaching Canada, Scandinavia and South Korea. The disease is caused not by bacteria or a virus but by prions, rogue proteins that infect the brain, causing a slow but unstoppable decline. Once these prions are in the environment, they linger for years, infecting new animals through soil, water and even plants.

For now, there has been no confirmed case of CWD jumping to humans, but that does not mean the danger is not there. Scientists remember all too well what happened with BSE, or mad cow disease, which took years to leap to people, with tragic consequences. **Experts are warning that CWD could be following a similar path, particularly as thousands of people regularly eat venison from infected deer without realising it.**

Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who has been sounding the alarm for years, says the risk is growing, yet governments are not taking it seriously enough. A recent report from 67 experts painted a bleak picture of what would happen if the disease spilt over to humans, predicting chaos in global food supplies, agriculture and trade, not to mention a major public health disaster. Despite this, surveillance and research funding are being cut just when they are needed most.

Some states are making the situation worse. In Wyoming, for example, large numbers of elk and deer are fed artificial food in winter to keep their populations high. Scientists say this is a recipe for disaster, bringing animals into close contact and making it easy for the disease to spread. Meanwhile, predators like wolves and mountain lions, which naturally target sick animals and help control the spread of CWD, are being aggressively culled.

It is not just scientists who are concerned. Hunters, many of whom rely on venison as a key part of their diet, are beginning to worry about the safety of their food. Yet many deer shot by hunters are never tested for CWD, and contaminated meat is being transported across state lines, increasing the risk of further spread. In some places, infected carcasses are even being dumped in landfill sites, raising fears that the disease could find new ways to take hold in the environment.

There are no easy solutions, but ignoring the problem is not one of them. Without action, experts warn that entire populations of deer and elk could be wiped out over time. The best way to slow the disease is to let nature take its course, allow predators to do their job and stop artificially feeding wild animals in ways that help CWD thrive.

Scientists are watching anxiously, knowing that if CWD ever does jump to humans, the world could be facing another crisis that no one saw coming. For now, all they can do is keep warning people, even if too many are still not listening.",51,1742489528.0,1jfpxoq

I know many states are looking to transition to chips, but it is extremely costly.  That would stop skimming.

Walmart also has a huge issue, and refused to do anything to help.

Far too many people use these cards at gas stations later in the evening or overnight. 

No one, especially the locations, is checking for card skimmers!

The public at large isn't taught about fraud, while the rest of us understand how to protect ourselves. 

Many are using these cards with online purchases.. why?!

I know SNAP was being replaced for a while if reported properly, but that has since been cancelled.  It was too costly, and I don't see that ever returning.

The public at large is too cavalier regarding these benefits; both in how they are able to obtain them and the spending habits.  It is almost encouraged to simply have more kids in fatherless homes!  Or it encourages families to not marry!  

In addition, I have seen several households where the mother has 5-6+ kids with 3+ different men and no man is in the house and no one is supporting them except HUD or Section 8 housing.  I don't care if you don't want to marry, but what happened to society to encourage men to not live with these kids and assist in taking care of them?!

mirmov6,xKiwiNova,"I want to draw attention to something important that I think a lot of people gloss over in discussion of Israel's military campaign in Gaza - *combat zones*.

The associated press recently [put out this map](https://i.imgur.com/Rym5mqu.jpeg), an estimation of the boundaries of the IDF's so called combat zones - invisible lines which the Israeli military draws and declares anyone within as a valid military target by virtue of their presence.

As you can see by the map, these ""combat zones"" are typically very broad, and also aren't actually well defined. Despite this, the IDF uses their existence to justify civilian casualties by asserting that anyone present in them *must* be Hamas or someone trying to martyr themselves. In case it wasn't obvious, these combat zones often cover neighborhoods home to tens of thousands of people. 

Imagine if - for instance, the Peoples Liberation Army decided that actually the entirety of Harlem was a combat region (without even making that information available to New Yorkers beforehand) and killed anyone present. I don't think many would regard this as much more than the wanton murder of civilians.

And I am not being hyperbolic about these killings - take for instance the case of two elderly Palestinian civilians who were killed as reported originally by [HaMakom](https://www.ha-makom.co.il/1057919-2/) (in Hebrew) and can be read about in English [here](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6621/Euro-Med-Monitor-reveals-details-of-Israeli-army%E2%80%99s-execution-of-elderly-Palestinian-couple-after-it-used-them-as-human-shields) or [here](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-16/ty-article/idf-reportedly-used-elderly-gazan-as-human-shield-tied-explosive-around-his-neck/00000195-0e56-d1b4-a7fd-cf7742bf0000). Essentially, IDF forces abducted an elderly Palestinian man and forced him to enter suspected booby-trapped buildings (as part of the alleged ***Mosquito Protocol***). Eventually, he and his wife were released; however, the IDF unit that abducted them did not inform the other units operating in the area that they had done so, so shortly after their release, **the 80 year old man and his wife were shot dead by Israeli forces operating in the area**.

Another report by [Haaertz](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2024-12-18/ty-article-magazine/.premium/idf-soldiers-expose-arbitrary-killings-and-rampant-lawlessness-in-gazas-netzarim-corridor/00000193-da7f-de86-a9f3-fefff2e50000) focuses on the Netzarim corridor, one of the most infamous examples of these kill zones. I will leave you with the following quotes from soldiers:

>*Every woman is a scout, or a man in disguise ... Anyone on a bicycle could be killed, claiming cyclists were terrorists*

...

>""After shootings, bodies are not collected, attracting packs of dogs who come to eat them.""

...

>""One time, guards spotted someone approaching from the south. We responded as if it was a large militant raid. We took positions and just opened fire.

>I'm talking about dozens of bullets, maybe more. For about a minute or two, we just kept shooting at the body. People around me were shooting and laughing.""

>When they approached the body, the soldier said they discovered that the person they had just gunned down was ""just a boy, maybe 16 (years old).""

>The battalion commander responded: ""Anyone crossing the line is a terrorist, no exceptions, no civilians. Everyone's a terrorist.""

...

>""The sight haunts me,"" said the soldier in his account in the report. Three of the Palestinians were killed in the barrage, while the survived with his hands in the air.

>""We put him in a cage set up near our position, stripped off his clothes, and left him there,"" the soldier recounts.

>""Soldiers passing by spat on him. It was disgusting. Finally, a military interrogator came, questioned him briefly while holding a gun to his head, then ordered his release.""

Perhaps these soldiers are lying. Perhaps the fact that their stories of indiscriminate killing seemingly independently cooberate one another, and reports from [doctors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html), [humanitarian organizations](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/), the [UN](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/opt/20241106-Gaza-Update-Report-OPT.pdf), and the [ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-kc-applications-arrest-warrants-situation-state) is merely a coincidence. I certainly do not *want* these reports to be true - *it would be preferable to imagine this as some grand antisemetic conspiracy* rather than think that reports like that of:

>""	One Division 99 reservist recalled watching a video feed from a drone showing ""an adult with two children crossing the forbidden line."" 

>""We had them under complete surveillance with the drone and weapons aimed at them—they couldn't do anything,"" he said. **""Suddenly we heard a massive explosion. A combat helicopter had fired a missile at them.** Who thinks it's legitimate to fire a missile at children? And with a helicopter? This is pure evil."" 

...are real. But I find evidence that this is an elaborate hoax to be lacking.

I find it disturbing that so few people seem to be aware of these reports - neighborhoods and their residents being so casually designated for termination - dozens of *Bucha*s happening with the West's enthusiastic support, and I hope that having read these accounts you understand why some people find Israel's military operations in Gaza objectionable.",275,1742462114.0,1jfjr5c

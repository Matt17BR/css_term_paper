*A series of about 25 powerful explosions with bright flashes in the sky followed by a large fire at an oil depot in the Russian city of Engels were reported by residents and Saratov Oblast Governor Roman Busargin on Telegram early on Jan. 8.*

*Several drones were allegedly shot down by air defences with the debris setting fire to ‚Äúan industrial facility. Firefighters and emergency services are on the scene,‚Äù he claimed. The Astra Telegram channel posted eyewitness videos of the city's night skyline with the sounds of drones and a photo of a massive fire in the area of the oil depot.*

*An overnight drone strike has targeted a strategic Russian airbase in Engels, Saratov Oblast, causing a fire at an oil depot, Russian outlet Astra and OSINT analysts reported on Jan. 8.*

*The drone attack resulted in a fire at the oil depot of the Kristall Rosrezerv plant, which stored fuel for the Engels-2 airbase. This airbase is one of the bases for Russia's strategic aviation, including Tu-95MS bombers, which carry out missile strikes on Ukraine.*

*The location of the drone strike was identified by comparing video footage of the incident with images from Google Maps. Later, photographs published by the governor of Saratov Oblast, Roman Busargin, confirmed the location. Serhiy Bratchuk, a representative of the Ukrainian Volunteer Army South, provided the exact geographical coordinates of the strike on Engels.*

*""The location of the strike on Engels is 51¬∞26'12.8‚Ä≥ N 46¬∞05'26.3‚Ä≥ E,"" he wrote in a Telegram post.*

*‚ÄúThis is the Kristall Rosrezerv plant (Engels), a Federal State Unitary Enterprise. Storage of aviation fuel for the Engels-2 airbase.‚Äù Later, the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, Andriy Yermak, indirectly commented on the strike on logistical facilities in Engels. ""Logistics must burn,"" he said.*

*OSINTtechnical project analysts reported that an intense fire is ongoing at the facility.*

*The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that 11 drones were ""destroyed"" over Saratov Oblast, four over the Kursk and Rostov oblasts, three over the Belgorod and Bryansk oblasts, two over Krasnodar Krai, one over Volgograd Oblast, and four over the waters of the Azov Sea.*

*Ukraine‚Äôs SBU Security Service and the National Police have arrested two individuals suspected of bombing a railroad track in Khmelnytskyi Oblast under the guidance of Russia's FSB Federal Security Service, the SBU press service reported on Jan. 8.*

*The saboteurs placed a homemade explosive device under the railroad tracks and activated it as a cargo train approached. The incident was recorded on a mobile phone camera to provide ""evidence"" to the aggressor state.*

*Fortunately, no one was injured in the incident, as the train driver managed to stop the train in time, the SBU reported.*

*The suspects were identified as two residents of Khmelnytskyi Oblast, aged 28 and 29. One of them is a drug addict, and the other is a deserter who left his military unit and was in hiding. They were recruited by the FSB through Telegram channels promising easy money. During the search, law enforcement officers seized components of the explosive device and mobile phones containing evidence of the sabotage. The suspects have been charged under Article 258-3 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (terrorist act committed during wartime). They face life imprisonment with confiscation of property.*",25,1736338437.0,1hwaxte

[https://agora.echelon.pl/objects/39efdb63-3ffd-4521-913e-f275bce9ec4f](https://agora.echelon.pl/objects/39efdb63-3ffd-4521-913e-f275bce9ec4f)

Another great post by Polish analyst Daniel Szeligowski, about ‚ÄúRussian security concerns‚Äù related to [\#NATO](https://agora.echelon.pl/tag/nato) and [\#Ukraine](https://agora.echelon.pl/tag/ukraine). All following text is Daniel‚Äôs, written originally in English, with no quote block for readability.

In early 2014, Ukraine was a neutral country, with a pro-Russian president, and with 70% of Ukraine‚Äôs population against NATO membership. Yet Russia violated Ukraine‚Äôs neutrality and annexed Crimea, then launched a covert invasion of Ukraine in the east.

Petro Poroshenko won the presidential election in 2014 having promised a settlement with Russia, keeping a special status of the Russian language in Ukraine. He was initially sceptical regarding NATO accession, underlined Ukraine must rely on its own strength to provide security.

Zelensky also won the presidential election promising to compromise with Russia - to stop shooting, sit down with Putin and talk. He was even more sceptical regarding NATO accession. Asked about NATO, he once famously said he never pays anyone a visit if he has not been invited.

Zelensky was ready to drop Ukraine‚Äôs NATO membership bid in an exchange for the Russian troops withdrawing from Ukraine, and the talks were held already before 2022. And yet Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

In the first weeks of the invasion, Zelensky was yet again ready to drop Ukraine‚Äôs NATO bid. But he wanted to obtain international security guarantees. So Putin put forward demands that Russia must be consulted before any aid would be given to Ukraine in the event of aggression.

Both Poroshenko and Zelensky were initially sceptical regarding Ukraine‚Äôs accession to NATO. Both wanted to get a deal with Putin. And Putin himself pushed both of them to seek NATO membership out of no other viable alternatives.

Putin has shown no willingness to compromise with Ukraine. His war aims remain maximalist - subjugating Ukraine and changing its regime. He seeks Ukraine‚Äôs partition, and will turn what is left of Ukraine into a Russian protectorate. Nothing to do with his ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù about NATO.

Regrettably, Russia‚Äôs imperial self-conception is that of Russian elites at large, not just Putin. Russian leadership simply cannot reconcile with the existence of a sovereign Ukrainian statehood. So any sustainable Ukrainian-Russian compromise is currently not within reach.",1,1736347680.0,1hwaxte

*The Russian military has significantly intensified its shelling of Sudzha and nearby villages in Kursk Oblast, Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi, a press officer for Ukraine‚Äôs temporary military commandant‚Äôs office on Russian territory, said on Jan. 7.*

*‚ÄúCivilians are primarily staying at home or in shelters because the enemy has greatly increased its shelling of the town of Sudzha and the neighboring villages,‚Äù Dmytrashkivskyi told Ukrainian TV broadcasters. ‚ÄúMany of them simply no longer exist.‚Äù*

*Since Aug. 6, 2024, 36 civilians have been killed due to aerial and artillery shelling in Sudzha, and about 100 others have been injured with varying degrees of severity, he added.*

*The officer reported that Russian forces are actively using S-300 anti-air missile systems to bombard the city. According to Dmytrashkivskyi, Ukrainian intelligence assesses that Russian troops are using 12,000 FPV drones, around 800 Lancet drones, and 2,500 other small UAVs in Kursk Oblast, attempting to dislodge Ukrainian forces from the region.*",27,1736339273.0,1hwaxte

I am so disappointed in the US foreign policy. 
We fucking fought, bled and died with American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. When the US invoked article 5 post 9/11 we were there. We supported the US with an all in attitude. If you think we were just a small supporting nation just helping with logistics and camp maintenance, watch armadillo. This was our afghanistan war for 10+ years. Furthermore we've been there in every American and UN led conflict since the 90's. Kosovo, Cyprus, Libya, the balcans you name it. Every time we answered the call.

 Cut to 20 years later. The threat of use of force against our sovereign nation, economic pressure and hateful rethoric from what we believed to be one of our closest allies.

America have got all that they wanted in Greenland since 1949: Thule airbase, radar stations, ICBM. If you really wanted to protect your national security interests in the region all you had to do was ask. We would coordinate, support and join your efforts in securing the arctic region.

m60xmxm,TheTelegraph,"***The Telegraph reports:***

The home of the impeached South Korean president was turned into a ‚Äúfortress‚Äù on Wednesday as authorities prepared to mount a second arrest attempt.

[Layers of barbed wire and vehicle blockades](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/05/south-korea-president-barricade-stop-arrest-rally-seoul/)¬†were set up outside Yoon Suk Yeol‚Äôs compound as hundreds of his supporters rallied to his cause.

Mr Yoon avoided an arrest attempt last week after his bungled Dec 3 martial law decree plunged¬†[South Korea](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/south-korea/)¬†into its worst political crisis in decades. The debacle has since led to his suspension and¬†[impeachment](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/12/27/south-korea-parliament-impeaches-acting-president/).

Youn Kun-young, an opposition lawmaker, has now said Mr Yoon‚Äôs home is ‚Äúturning into a fortress‚Äù, as guards installed barbed wire and used buses as blockades in anticipation of a second arrest attempt.

The 64-year-old former prosecutor was at home when investigators attempted to enter last week, but around 200 presidential¬†[security service members linked arms](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/03/south-korea-president-yoon-arrest-protest-house/)¬†to prevent them from reaching him, forcing the authorities to stand down.

The suspended leader was inside at the time, according to police, and¬†[vowed to ‚Äúfight‚Äù](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/02/yoon-vows-to-fight-to-end-south-korea-standoff-continues/)¬†alongside his supporters outside, who he could see on a livestream.

Now, a fresh arrest warrant has been issued.

The leason ofcource is to not get to dependent on a hugh country. The EU did the same with China. Some EU countries did the same to some extent with Russia (the gas).

The USA is on a path to loose the influence of the world as they had sadly. The EU will break free on US military support, China and the US wont do business as usual, Souht America is aming for China on one hand and the EU on the next. Most eastern, souhtern and/or any Asian countries has more trade with China and most of them with the EU than they have with the US. It's not like the USA has the future in front of them (dont come draging with AI or Google, Musk etc. (Temporary thing with US speed at the moment and they are loosing shares on the global market anyway in the long run)), at least not with the the track they been on the last decade or so. The USD is mostly their asset and the fact that they had many allies that saw them as a safe haven for investments. 

Canada, even if it hurts, need to diversify more and get less dependent on the US. I hope for sure the US stays within the warmth of an allies. But as the last period with Trump they will problably speed up this influence lose again. Many countries has thought about the US as a good and reliabel partner and thats why they have been able to have the growth they had. Without that they will fall quickly.

>Rados≈Çaw Sikorski was speaking on Monday in France, whose own president, Emmanuel Macron, had earlier in the day accused Musk of ‚Äúsupporting a new international reactionary movement and intervening directly in elections, including in Germany‚Äù.

>

>When asked whether Musk might seek to influence the outcome of Poland‚Äôs elections ‚Äì in which the leading candidates are a liberal centrist supported by Sikorski‚Äôs party and a conservative rival backed by the main opposition ‚Äì the foreign minister said that that was a question for Musk himself.

>‚ÄúIt seems that he is already trying to do this \[influence politics\] in the UK,‚Äù said Sikorski, quoted by the Polish Press Agency (PAP). ‚ÄúAnd in Poland, influencing Polish elections from abroad is illegal.‚Äù

>‚ÄúWe must prepare to protect our democratic process so that Poles, not foreigners, choose our president,‚Äù added the foreign minister.

>On Tuesday, Sikorski also used his personal account on X ‚Äì the social media platform owned by Musk ‚Äì to repost a Politico Europe article titled ‚ÄúPressure mounts on EU to use legal weapons against Musk‚Äôs interference‚Äù.

>

>In recent weeks, Musk, who is a close advisor to Donald Trump and part of the incoming president‚Äôs proposed administration, has criticised Germany‚Äôs government and expressed support for the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of next month‚Äôs German federal elections.

>That prompted expressions of criticism and concern from a number of leading European politicians, with the European Commission announcing that it would look into the issue.

>Musk has also recently launched a series of attacks on British Prime Minister Kier Starmer. Last month, he met with Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing populist Reform UK, raising speculation that the billionaire may offer the party financial support. However, two days ago Musk called for Farage to be replaced as leader.

>

>On Monday, Politico Europe‚Äôs editor-at-large, Nicholas Vinocur, suggested in his Brussels Playbook column that, once Musk is done with Germany and the UK, he ‚Äúcould wade in on the upcoming Polish presidential election in May‚Äù.

>Incumbent President Andrzej Duda, who is a conservative opponent of the current Polish government and has a close relationship with Trump, will leave office this year after his second and final term expires.

>The ruling coalition hopes that one of its three candidates will be elected as president, allowing the government to proceed with an agenda that has been stymied by Duda. Among them, Warsaw mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski is tipped as the most likely winner.

>But Duda‚Äôs former PiS party is backing Trzaskowski‚Äôs main rival, Karol Nawrocki. Meanwhile, the far-right Confederation (Konfederacja) has put forward as its candidate S≈Çawomir Mentzen, whose party is aligned with the AfD in the European Parliament.",9,1736287910.0,1hvy9we

Biden Administration Set to Announce ‚ÄòSubstantial‚Äô Final Weapons Package for Ukraine
The Biden administration is set to announce a massive, final weapons aid package for Ukraine as part of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin‚Äôs visit to Germany this week to meet with representatives of about 50 partner nations who have come to Ukraine‚Äôs defense since Russia invaded nearly three years ago

WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The Biden administration is set to announce a massive, final weapons aid package for Ukraine as part of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin‚Äôs visit to Germany on Thursday to meet with representatives of about 50 partner nations who have come to Ukraine‚Äôs defense since Russia invadednearly three years ago, two senior defense officials said. 
The officials did not provide an exact dollar amount but said the package was expected to be ‚Äúsubstantial,‚Äù although it would not include all of the roughly $4 billion left in the congressionally authorized funding for Ukraine. There likely would be ‚Äúmore than a couple of billion dollars‚Äù remaining for the incoming Trump defense team to provide to Ukraine if it chose to do so, the officials said Tuesday in briefing reporters traveling with Austin. 
Ukraine is in the midst of launching a second offensive in Russia‚Äôs Kursk regionand is facing a barrage of long-range missiles and ongoing advances from Russia as both sides seek to put themselves in the strongest negotiating point possible before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. 
Biden defense officials working on Ukraine have been in contact with Trump‚Äôs transition team to discuss ‚Äúall the issues that we believe are important,‚Äù one of the officials said. 
Austin‚Äôs trip to Ramstein Air Base will be his final meeting with the group he organized to come to Ukraine‚Äôs defense after Russia‚Äôs invasion in February 2022. Together those nations have provided more than $126 billion in weapons and military training and assistance. Those packages have included millions of rounds of ammunition, advanced fighter jets, air defense systems, counter-UAV systems and even tanks.
The U.S. has provided $66 billion of that total. 
The package to be announced on Thursday will be drawn from existing stockpiles with a goal of getting most of the weapons pledged to Ukraine by the time Trump is sworn in., one of the defense officials said.
On Dec. 30, the administration announced a separate $1.25 billion aid package, part of a series of aid announcements as it hurried to get as much military assistance to Ukraine as it can before President Joe Biden leaves office. The officials said roughly 80% to 90% of all stockpile equipment promised has already been provided to Ukraine.",154,1736290300.0,1hw07nd

So he tried dissing on Canada which got him a little attention. But the Canadian PM didn't really counter with anything newsworthy and that story died out quickly - Elon still had all the media focus.

So Trump tried the Panama Canal story but most Americans didn't know what that was or didn't care and that story died quickly.

Then Trump remembered the last time around when everyone got up in arms about his threats against Greenland. He couldn't care less about Greenland, but he tried the story again.

This time the Greenland PM Mute Egede took the opportunity to put a little pressure on Denmark and connect Trumps statements with Greenland's quest for independence (this is a good internal political topic in Greenland which always gets a few extra votes in the next election).

So the Danish PM had to take the opposite stand and make a statement against the sale of Greenland (a preposterous concept of course).

Really.. none of you have any doubt that you might be on the wrong side of history?

It's a cruel conflict. But there is something you can examine beyond the propaganda of any faction:

If Israel is a democracy, there is equality among its citizens. So why does Israel define itself as a Jewish state and its laws favor the Jewish population?

If you go to the basics, you will see that Israel in its current version is by design an ethno-state (a genocidal, expansionist and terrorist ethno-state) and that explains everything that seems to make no sense.

Perhaps the process was accelerated because their current leaders want to expand their power and avoid judicial consequences. Perhaps it is due to the relationship they have with a great power like the United States that sees Israel as a way to advance its interests.

This archive, comprising approximately 30 million pages, documents various aspects of World War II in the Netherlands, including information about victims, resistance activities, and efforts to hide Jewish residents. Ôøº

Previously, access to these records was restricted to in-person visits at the National Archives in The Hague. With the expiration of access restrictions at the start of 2025, the digital archive has been made publicly accessible, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the extent and nature of Dutch collaboration with Nazi occupiers. Ôøº

The Netherlands, despite its active resistance movement, is considered a collaborating nation. The publication of these records is expected to shed more light on the extent and variety of ways in which people collaborated, aiding historians and the country in coming to terms with its past. Ôøº

This development is part of a broader trend in recent decades, where there has been an increase in research on Nazi collaborators, both at the national and individual levels.

*Excerpt*

The Justice Department, together with its state co-plaintiffs, filed an amended complaint today in its antitrust lawsuit against RealPage, to sue six of the nation‚Äôs largest landlords for participating in algorithmic pricing schemes that harmed renters.

The amended complaint alleges the landlords ‚Äî Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC (Greystar); Blackstone‚Äôs LivCor LLC (LivCor); Camden Property Trust (Camden); Cushman & Wakefield Inc and Pinnacle Property Management Services LLC (Cushman); Willow Bridge Property Company LLC (Willow Bridge) and Cortland Management LLC (Cortland) ‚Äî participated in an unlawful scheme to decrease competition among landlords in apartment pricing, harming millions of American renters. Together, these landlords operate more than 1.3 million units in 43 states and the District of Columbia. The Attorneys General of Illinois and Massachusetts joined the amended complaint as co-plaintiffs, increasing the total number of State and Commonwealth co-plaintiffs to 10. At the same time, the Justice Department filed a proposed consent decree with landlord Cortland that requires it to cooperate with the government, stop using its competitors‚Äô sensitive data to set rents and stop using the same algorithm as its competitors without a corporate monitor.",5,1736345816.0,1hwkas2

The net result is, smaller incidents like a tree falling or wind taking off some of your siding go unreported, because customers don't want to get dropped - IE,  you're forced to pay for insurance, and then, forced not to use it.

By MICHELLE L. PRICE

Unpaid medical bills will no longer appear on credit reports, where they can block people from mortgages, car loans or small business loans, according to a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will remove $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, according to the bureau, which means lenders will no longer be able to take that into consideration when deciding to issue a loan.

The change is estimated to raise the credit scores by an average of 20 points and could lead to 22,000 additional mortgages being approved every year, according to the bureau. Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement announcing the rule that it would be ‚Äúlifechanging‚Äù for millions of families.

‚ÄúNo one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency,‚Äù she said.

Harris also announced that states and local governments have used a sweeping 2021 pandemic-era aid package to eliminate more than $1 billion in medical debt for more than 700,000 Americans.

The administration announced plans for the rule in fall 2023.

The CFPB said that medical debt is a poor predictor of an individual‚Äôs ability to repay a loan. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said last year that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.

Someone phrased it very well: it's not Identity Theft, it's *Reputation* Theft. The credit bureaus don't verify your identity, they verify your fiscal reputation. 

Basically, ""does this guy pay you back when you loan him money?"" 

Health care is not a loan. Except for chronic issues, it's not something you plan into your monthly budget (aside from insurance payments). But largely, it's not something you plan for. If i financially overextend myself by getting a car i really cant afford, thats on me and maybe people should be less trusting when loaning me money. If i get rear ended by a drunk driver or get unexpected cancer, how is that on me???!! 

And this is all ignoring the fact that not everyone has insurance, and those who do often get claims denied, and even then hospitals just make up stuff.... you see a doctor once, and they'll just keep sending you bills for more and more things for 8 months, and there's no way to know what's waiting in the wings. Because you also have no idea what the cost will be upfront, you can't make an ""informed purchase decision"" like in any other ""free market"" business.

I have the money to pay the fucking bill; that‚Äôs not the point. The point is that this hospital charged me almost $1,400 *over and above what my insurance company paid* for four stitches, and it was the worse medical experience I‚Äôve ever had, and I‚Äôve been to the ER a few times in the past and have had surgery performed on me.

My insurance company paid most of the bill. That means the *smallest* portion of that bill was $1,400. For four fucking stitches. It was ten minutes of actual work, and it took me *nine hours* to have it done. Fucking amateurs.

I told them I wouldn‚Äôt pay it. I said I‚Äôd agree to $500, and that was because I happened to be in a good mood that day and just wanted to be done with it.

Apparently, earlier in 2023 there was a coordination of benefits issue between my primary and secondary insurance. I was not made aware of this in writing. When I looked at my bills on the hospital's website it showed my portion owed as $0 and on my primary insurance website it just said ""pending"". Because of this, I never received a bill. Instead, it went into a secondary ""collection"" account which then was reported to the credit bureaus. I am working on getting it fixed now but this would have made the difference of me being approved.

It just allows him time to meet with his lawyer, and gives his lawyer time to look at disclosure, which would not be received if he pleads guilty, and consider all defense options. Judges will enter a NG for defendants at any hesitation in his responses, to get him more time to discuss the consequences of his choices with an attorney, especially this early on in the case.¬†


The only time to plead guilty in a felony case that early is to get jeopardy attached during the change of plea hearing (courts usually have defendant raise their hands and swear an oath that their statements during the plea will be the truth) and prevent more serious charges from being added.


Prosecutors are often trained to be on alert. If a defendant pleads guilty early on, and our office has not offered a plea agreement, it could be a defense ""trick"" (not really a trick, just quick thinking opportunism) to avoid more serious charges, so pause the case or dismiss without prejudice.

It sounds like Jack Smith's report is in two volumes, one covering the content of the DC case (focused on Trump's effort to overturn the election), and one covering the content of the Florida case (focused on the classified documents).

While Trump and his co-defendants from the classified documents case are of course asking to block everything, Smith has indicated only the volume related to the DC case may be released to the public for now. Given that Nauta and De Oliveira are still facing charges, they at least have a legitimate reason to contest the public release of information that they can show would prejudice a jury.

Given a lot of details about the case are already public knowledge (including the indictment that of course directly accuses them of crimes), I don't see how they could argue the entire volume of the report must be withheld, but Smith does likely have to take their complaints seriously.

Unfortunately the case is before Cannon (who ruled that Smith wasn't lawfully appointed) so it would take an order from the 11th circuit that she was wrong to lift her hold on the report. Per the article, it isn't clear whether she has authority to actually block the report. Of course, ignoring her order would likely encourage her to seek to dismiss the case (although we all know it will be dismissed soon after Trump takes office).",51,1736273604.0,1hvxijr

First and foremost: keep your cats inside.

One of the most obvious steps you can take is to not feed them raw poultry, raw eggs, and raw milk. I'm also personally avoiding feeding my cat cans (of cooked food) that I've had for less than a month such that there is more likely ample time for a recall if needed.

Additionally, wash your hands thoroughly any time you handle eggs or poultry.

Lastly, don't wear outdoor shoes inside your home. You may not realize it, but you're likely tracking around particles of bird poop, which can carry the disease.

Don't mess around with this. Cases are still overall sparse right now, but there are strong signs to suggest this will get bigger over the course of 2025.",393,1736233516.0,1hvgqxv

m5twsf7,IHeartBadCode,"For those wondering, Tennessee's law is different than all the rest of them.  Tennessee is attempting to make it a criminal offense rather than the Government trying to regulate a business.

It's this idea that you can toss people into jail for distribution of porn that's got a lot of the federal court system in a tizzy.  If Tennessee was only attempting a Texas ban we'd have a different story.

But Tennessee is trying to take the whole porn thing to a new level and there's not many who believe the federal justice system is going to let criminalizing the whole thing stand.

Like it's one thing if they were just trying to regulate business, but the notion of tossing people in jail I know that's not going to sit well with Roberts and Kavanaugh, these two are usually anti-new criminal law.

Kavanaugh especially as he's got quite the list of opinions he's signed onto that try to limit everyone's attempts to limit free speech.

* Moody v NetChoice LLC (2024)
* NRA v Vullo (2024)
* Lindke v Freed (2024)
* Counterman v. Colorado (2023) - This one especially

I mean he even signed on to Ashcroft v ACLU for the ACLU in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, indicating that COPA (the Child Online Protection Act) was likely a substantial over-breadth that violated the first amendment.

So even if this makes it to SCOTUS, the current composition of SCOTUS does NOT assure this to be the slam dunk that some think it will be.  The current Justices are really hesitant to grant anyone brand new criminality power.  Kavanaugh signed on to the denial of Texas' abortion travel ban.  He was not cool with Texas getting a brand new criminal power.

The Justices don't seem to have problems with allowing States brand new regulatory power over businesses, but brand new criminality like Tennessee's law attempts is perhaps a line too far for the majority to cross.  This may be their limit on how much they'll bend over for conservatives.

But it is important that everyone notes that Tennessee's law is very different than the other ones that have come out from other states.",276,1736228758.0,1hvhbok

m5q6iem,Morepastor,"I want to point out something. One of the reasons that his people were upset with him is the Visa issue. Let‚Äôs talk about it because it is also topical here now. 

Pre 9/11 India was graduating so many software engineers it was becoming a commodity career and many US tech companies were struggling to find staff because the US had a relaxed HB1 program and the labor was readily available. 

Post 9/11 since the hijacker‚Äôs were here on Visas this was a change we made under keeping America safe. 

The big technology companies worked a deal out with Canada and they opened operations in Vancouver and shifted the Indian labor to Canada. From what I have read they either allowed the non technical workers to come or chain migration to happen but Canada had a large number of Indian immigrants and the number has just increased significantly. I was reading that they were like 30% of the immigrant applications and the second most nationally is the Chinese who are 8%. The workers fill jobs that are in all fields from house cleaning to tech. The people of CA claim this has played a huge role in their housing crisis. 

In 2021 Canada had over 200,000 Indian workers imigrate. 
 
We have heard Musk say he wants to bring these tech workers back. There are law suits that are in play that are for the same reason. Oddly the Government is allowing Saudis to come to the US and learn to fly still but that is another story for another ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù day. We have also heard the incoming President say he uses immigrant labor on his hotel properties. The incoming President is abusing the HB1 Visa program because there are Americans that will clean rooms, wash dishes, and do labor if you pay a fair wage. Back when we used to hire people from India we had to hire at market, list the jobs here in the US and show we did and had no interest in the job, then we could go international but we couldn‚Äôt go pay less than the wage we advertised. We might be able to cut some fees for legal like you might pay a recruiter but to the people we hired they felt they won the lottery. Usually they would live in a moderate apartment send back most of the money they made and change their families lives. They were grateful to have the opportunity, paid taxes and were so kind. It was sad to see them go. When they left we closed that part of the division because we couldn‚Äôt find coders that were skilled in that area. 

So whatever Trump and Musk have planned is in part what brought him down and hurt Canada.",40,1736184656.0,1hv3jb8

m5sddzh,Ra_In,"Between this Giuliani case and the Alex Jones one, we seriously need reform of the civil court system so defendants who act in bad faith face real consequences.

In both of these cases the defendants have acted in bad faith every step of the way and dragged things out. Even after losing their initial cases it was only the halfway point of the legal battle due to their continued efforts to avoid handing over their assets.

In both cases, the defendants didn't cooperate with discovery (Giuliani just refusing to hand over evidence, and Jones lying about available evidence) - sure the judges ruled against them so the jury just had to determine damages, but this is just the same result as they'd get if they acted in good faith and handed over the damning evidence they withheld.

In Jones's case he used the stalling after losing to siphon assets to his parents, and in Giuliani's case he's clearly hiding assets and pretending to lose assets when directly asked about them... and in each case the worst consequence for their bad faith efforts will be to eventually hand over everything they would have surrendered if they complied up front. But the most likely result will be that each of them gets away with paying less than they should have - they'll be rewarded for their behavior.

I'm not a lawyer so I'm not qualified to make specific suggestions, but one way or another:

* There needs to be a way for a court to find that a defendant* is acting in bad faith egregiously enough or often enough that no further claims are taken in good faith, and their options for delay are severely restricted.

* There need to be better ways to prevent defendants from hiding assets, and less reliance on defendants complying with disclosing assets and handing them over. Especially with bad faith defendants, the courts need a way to (as early as possible) independently audit the defendant's assets and monitor them.

*Such rules could also be applied to a bad faith plaintiff should they end up liable for attorney's fees or end up as a the defendant in a counter-suit.",18,1736208405.0,1hv9kun

Excerpt on the Canadian case

> As the disease progressed over the next few days, she was intubated and put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) ‚Äî a life support technique that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs for patients with severe heart or lung conditions.

>She was also treated with three antiviral medications, including oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu), amantadine (Gocovri) and baloxavir (Xofluza).

>Because of concerns about the potential for a cytokine storm ‚Äî a potentially lethal condition in which the body releases too many inflammatory molecules ‚Äî she was put on a daily regimen of plasma exchange therapy, in which the patient‚Äôs plasma is removed in exchange for donated, health plasma.

>As the days went by, her viral load began to decrease; on Nov. 16, eight days after she‚Äôd been admitted, she tested negative for the virus.

>The authors of the report noted, however, that the viral load remained consistently higher in her lower lungs than in her upper respiratory tract ‚Äî suggesting that the disease may manifest in places not currently tested for it (like the lower lungs) even as it disappears from those that are tested (like the mouth and nose).

>She fully recovered and was discharged sometime after Nov. 28, when her intubation tube was removed.

>Genetic sequencing of the virus circulating in the teenager showed it was similar to the one circulating in wild birds, the D1.1 version. It‚Äôs a type of H5N1 bird flu that is related, but distinct, from the type circulating in dairy cows and is responsible for the vast majority of human cases reported in the U.S. ‚Äî most of which were acquired via dairy cows or commercial poultry. This is also the same version of the virus found in a Louisiana patient who experienced severe disease, and it showed a few mutations that researchers say increases the virus‚Äô ability to replicate in human cells.",203,1736197446.0,1hv9au9

‚Ä¢ Inflation: Grocery prices, car prices, fuel prices, everything prices. 

‚Ä¢ The Housing crisis. Home prices skyrocketing and availability being low. Homelessness appearing to be rising. Leads into:

‚Ä¢ Immigration:  Too many people coming into the country. Perceived loss of social and cultural cohesion.  ‚ÄúGhettoization‚Äù, stress on the housing and job markets

‚Ä¢ Increased crime/declining safety:  Theft appears to be rising, drug use appears to be rising. Perceived ‚Äúlight on crime‚Äù attitude for various offences‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Health care:  too many patients and not enough doctors. Long wait times for treatment that kill people

‚Ä¢ Drug policies:  Again on the ‚Äúlight on offenders‚Äù perception. People shooting heroin on the streets. ‚ÄúBad neighborhoods‚Äù expanding in city centres, homelessness again

‚Ä¢ Contributing to inflation through wasteful spending (see: foreign aid, government overreach, Ukraine, ArriveCAN app, Covid spending)

‚Ä¢ Climate change costs and annoyances (see: Federal Carbon Tax, suppression of natural resources industry, paper straws, elimination of single-use plastics) 

‚Ä¢ Corruption (see: SNC Lavalin election donations and the treatment of Jody-Wilson Raybould, the WE charity controversy and his vacations. The trucker convoys. 

‚Ä¢ International affairs. (See: perceived weakness in dealing with possible Chinese interference in Canadian elections, Chinese police stations, Indian assassinations of Canadian Politicians on Canadian soil)

‚Ä¢ Hypocrisy and personality issues/optics/gaffs see: smugness, fakeness, blackface, ‚Äúshe remembers it differently‚Äù, ‚Äúveterans are asking for more than we are willing to give‚Äù, cultural appropriation, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs 2015‚Äù, the SS guy being recognized in parliament, not being able to actually answer a single question ever. I could go on all day. DEI hirings, political correctness, woke-ism, and identity politics. 

Again, it doesn‚Äôt matter if all of these things are even real or not. THESE are the topics that are working against the Liberals. THESE are the issues that are placed on the negatives side of the scale and even a few of these with outweigh all of the positives on the scale. 

Not every voter knows about all of these issues (and I could list far more) but almost every voter has heard of some of these. Even the silly little things that could be hand-waved off are a constant reminder of the minor annoyance perceived to be brought on by Trudeau‚Äôs Liberals (I‚Äôm looking at you, paper straws). It seems so benign and silly, but it‚Äôs another straw on the camels back. And THATS what the Liberals have to dig their way out from under, whether it‚Äôs a justifiable criticism or not.

Again, I‚Äôm not saying all of these things are true or, if they are true, they the Liberals are responsible for these things, but the perception is there among enough Canadians to put the Libs in a negative light. 

I DO NOT ADVOCATE FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS LISTED AND I WILL NOT DEBATE THEIR LEGITIMACY. I‚Äôm just listing the things people talk about, for those who want to know why Trudeau and his party are so unpopular right now.",42,1736179730.0,1hunumm

Right now in my town we are struggling with them closing out any people that are not from their home country in employment. As soon as one of this particular people group gets into a hiring position they start hiring strictly from their ethnic group only, closing the door for regular Canadians. 

And they come with a different mindset - their country accepts corruption as a matter of course. Before, you could focus on assimilating them and bringing them up to speed that corruption is unacceptable here. But there are SO MANY now that the Canadian ethos of honesty is being destroyed.

So the only way I would encounter 'Liv' and 'Brian' is if Meta started using them to junk up my news feed. But they're doing that already with bots, and it's hard to imagine what more they could accomplish with full-blown AI.

I guess it's possible Meta is venturing into cybercrime. Like one of these things might be a great way to socially engineer the elderly out of their bank account information, or get a small child to reveal private information about their parents or family.....at scale.",10,1736041844.0,1htpz7j

This is just so baffling to me. Maybe I'm just dense? When I joined Facebook, the point was to connect with family and friends who were out of my area. I had a great time watching my nephews and niece grow up, seeing photos of them at their sporting events, band concerts, and all that. Or, people I went to school with, regaining a connection with them, and finding out where they are now.

But, what the fuck would be the point in connecting with an AI? At best, it's like connecting to a random stranger on Facebook. Why would you do it? I guess, if there was the tantalizing possibility of nudes and sex and stuff like that, I could understand the draw.

Is there another choice? Mental health treatment, particularly for the most acute and challenging individuals, is fucked in this country. We put the burden on cops, the ER, and the jail/prison system to deal with people who aren't able to exist peacefully in society but can't or won't willingly participate in treatment. 

And then a not insignificant portion of the public and elected/government officials get mad at the cops that they don't do better, despite also acknowledging that cops in the US are woefully undertrained and certainly don't have the years of education and training most mental health professionals do.

Clue: There aren't ""behavioral health professionals"" enough to answer 1% of emergency calls to police. Police do their best with what few tools they're given to stop a person who is out of control.

Annoying part is that we've been communicating about his weight with her and already assured her that his doctor has told us that BMI is not the most accurate because if he was a half inch shorter he would be a healthy weight. His weight and height are a direct result of genetics as me and his father were never tall or heavy people...  And that it was common for children who are hyperkinnectic to be skinnier than most. Because they constantly move.  

He came home from school writing that he was ugly meaning that they said something TO him about his body at school.

She body shamed my 14 year old and called DCS on us because my son doesn't fit the standard of what she thinks he should be.

My grandpa had been extremely sick for 3 days with a ‚Äú24 hour stomach bug‚Äù as my Grandma called it. Still had a fever Christmas Eve. Grandpa was about to take a Covid test, and Grandma threw a fit about how that would ruin Christmas and blah blah blah.

So guess who got Covid by December 26th. 

I‚Äôm immunocompromised. My mom is severely immunocompromised. We, no joke, spent two and a half years of our lives having no close contact with the outside world. I was the first one to get Covid, and got it December 15th last year. So I wore a mask on Christmas as my fever had broken and all family members agreed that they wanted me to attend, even though I still had a high enough viral load to test positive. So last Christmas I had Covid.

I‚Äôm a teacher, btw. Last spring break- sick. Last week of school- pneumonia. Several rounds of antibiotics for a skin condition over summer break. Bronchitis three times this Fall. My birthday/Fall Break- sick. Thanksgiving break- sick. I was extremely careful to not get sick at school this year so I could finally have a break from illness (I‚Äôve been on ~8 antibiotics this year). So of course this whole break has, yet again, been spent isolated and sick. 

My mom is thankfully surviving her first round of Covid without a hospital visit. My dad is doing okay. Roommate who came to Christmas is doing okay. But, because nobody was symptomatic and we didn‚Äôt know it was covid, we went to a hotel on December 26th, and a lot of stores and restaurants. Unmasked. Then visited severely immunocompromised family members on the 27th, when symptoms went from ‚ÄúHuh, I must be tired from the holidays‚Äù to ‚ÄúOh. This is either allergies or I‚Äôm sick.‚Äù Symptoms started as I was actively being smothered by two very hairy dogs, so I assumed allergies.

All in all, 14 people have definitely gotten Covid because my grandma refused to let my grandpa take a Covid test before Christmas. And we infected who knows how many other people. My immune system cannot handle anymore illness, nor antibiotics.",46,1735796055.0,1hrl43t

My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. 
I started out in the oilfield industry while he‚Äôs been doing it for 20 years. We work at the same place which is nice as it‚Äôs a camp and we can spend time together. Recently he got his room checked (normal-they do all the rooms)  and they found testosterone and other mild steroid use. He got banned.  
I have been working on and off for the last three months and desperately need to work and bring money in. If I quit there‚Äôs no ei or other job set up. He complains sometimes about him paying for more than me but his paychecks are triple mine and he was able to work the last few months where we got stopped due to environment and woodpeckers. 

I said I needed to stay and work. He said I‚Äôm being a coward and I should take a stand and leave. I need to pay debt down. And Christmas. And I need a job. 

He thinks the company was out to get him so I should quit and back him up. I‚Äôm newer to this but established a good relationship and I‚Äôm trying to move up by taking courses on the side.

I see the critical path to understanding and controlling him like this.

Dude was insecure enough to take steroids.

He focused on how much more he made than you (phrased as a complaint, another way to offset insecurity)

He lost his job.

He got outed for using steroids.

Now you have income he doesn‚Äôt, and are working around guys and he can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening.

He was already unable to feel like enough for his ‚Äòman in the mirror‚Äô and now he is less.  He is in for a very, very rough ride, and if you stand next to him he will probably grab in like a life safety vest and push you under water to stay afloat.

If you‚Äôre going to stay with him, 
A) keep your job.
B) therapy. For him. I seldom ever recommend therapy because so many people already know and their problem is probably in their unconscious anyways‚Ä¶ his problem is with his ego. Therapy is the right tool.

I agree totally. Stepmom should *never* speak to you that way no matter what. Being that afraid of something that much that's constantly around is also awful. You should've just been allowed to go to your mom.

Your mom needs to manage the situation with your sister & her & your dad need to be guided by their legal advisers about what's best here.

Hi! Sorry for the weird formatting since this was done on mobile + on a throwaway account since I don‚Äôt want my family finding this out. I‚Äôm really desperate for the insight of people who don‚Äôt know me and aren‚Äôt biased.

My parents 54m and 56f have shared custody of me, 16f, so I stay one week in my dad‚Äôs house and a week in my mom‚Äôs house. My dad and mom both remarried, mom married Josh, 57m and dad married Alice, 50f.

I have always had good relationship with my stepmom, she always treated me nicely, and insisted I mustn‚Äôt see her as a mom but as a friend. keep in mind she is much wealthier than my dad, and purchased his house and the beach house they currently own.

For Christmas, me and my sister, Selena, 19f, decided to go to my stepmom‚Äôs beach house with my dad and step sibling. also keep in mind that the beach has insects and spiders, as it is very tropical + I have a serious debilitating phobia of spiders which all of my family knows about.

Everyday I used to find spiders in my room, which was really hard to deal with, since I would just try to pretend I didn‚Äôt see them until I could find someone to get them out. Regardless, one day, my stepmother was helping me get the spider that was in my pillowcase, of course, I freaked out. 

I suggested that I could get an Uber to my mom‚Äôs place, which isn‚Äôt far away, since I really wasn‚Äôt enjoying the vacation because of that but could see them in the city for New Year‚Äôs Eve.

she got extremely upset at that, saying that I was nothing more than a spoiled little b word and that I was a cow and that I could just call my mom but nobody wants me in their house anyway. I started ugly crying, this wasn‚Äôt the first time she called me stuff like that but we had a friendly relationship now.

I called my mom and she threatened my dad, who defended my stepmom, and called him a bad father, and now is fighting for full custody of me and that really hurt my father.

I know that this has caused a strain on my dad and stepmother‚Äôs relationship, and that if they divorce my father is losing the house and a place to live, as he doesn‚Äôt work and makes money anymore. My sister is blaming me, saying I could have stayed a few more days,  but my mother says no matter how I freaked out, Alice could never say these things to me.

Was I the AH? How do I navigate this?

21 degrees during the day is by no means unreasonable or unusual, and many people have higher temperatures than that. So I don't think your room mate is being unreasonable in wanting 21 degrees in her living space. It's your preferences that are the outlier here, not hers.

But of course that doesn't solve your problem, and as someone who would also find 21 degrees too warm, I sympathise. The long and the short of it is that you are not really compatible as roommates because your needs are in opposition to each other.

Can you compromise so that you have the temperature you each prefer in your own rooms and the middle ground in the shared areas?

As for the cost of heating, I think you are coming off as a cheapskate. Also, it's very energy inefficient to have very different temperatures in a flat. So if you insist on having parts of the place unusually cold, you make it more expensive to heat up the other parts of the place.

My (32F) roommate (28F) got stranded at work today. My husband (33M) was still at work for another 45 minutes.

I told her she could wait for a ride because I know there was no way I'm getting that money back on her first check. She already owes back rent for being here for a month and contributing nothing. She called me heartless then told me not to worry because she sees what kind of friend I am. She said it was freezing outside and she could die of hypothermia. We live in the south and it was 43¬∞F. Later, she called me right before my husband was going to come get her and said ""someone was nice and is giving me a lift home so save your precious gas"". I shrugged it off but she's not talking to me. So. Am I the asshole?

I (18M) just finished high school and live with my mom, who‚Äôs deeply religious and conservative. She recently announced that she plans to send me to an Islamic boarding school for at least five years. That means no college, no job, no pursuing my goals‚Äîjust being stuck in a school that I don‚Äôt want to attend.

Here‚Äôs the confusing part: my older brother is in college now. He started a bit later, so maybe she‚Äôs trying to repeat that process with me, but honestly, I don‚Äôt want to wait. I‚Äôve been looking forward to working and going to college straight away. I want to start building my future now, not five years from now.

The worst part is that I don‚Äôt even believe anymore (I‚Äôve kept this to myself for obvious reasons). So, the idea of going to this school feels even more stifling and out of place for me.

Today, she told me it was final‚Äîshe‚Äôs taking me to this school whether I like it or not. That‚Äôs when I snapped. I told her, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs my life, and I‚Äôm the one who gets to decide. I‚Äôm not a little kid anymore, and you can‚Äôt control me like this.‚Äù

She immediately started crying and saying stuff like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve sacrificed everything for you, and this is how you repay me?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. On the one hand, I feel bad for upsetting her, but on the other, I feel like I have the right to decide my own future. 

Now I‚Äôm sitting here, waiting to see what happens next. I‚Äôm torn between guilt and frustration. So, AITA for standing up for myself, even if it made her cry? Or should I have handled this differently?

This guilt trip is, by design, making you feel sad for your mom. Emotional manipulation is a really great tactic, but I think you need to look past that and ask yourself this question. Will your mom still love you and be there for you if you decide for yourself? ¬†I do not believe so. I think she will kick you out and shut you out of her life. This isn‚Äôt love of a mother. This is manipulation of a religious extremist then.

My mom is an extremely religious person too. She also wanted to control my life. So I got married and moved far from her home. Does she still attempt to control me? Absolutely! Mind you, I am in my 40‚Äôs and married for 20 years. This time she tried to move in with me and my husband because, ‚ÄúYou owe me this. I sacrificed everything for you.‚Äù ¬†My response was, ‚ÄúYou gave birth to me and raised me because that was your responsibility as a parent. This was your choice and I do not have to do anything. You do not own me just because you gave birth to me. That is not how any of this works.‚Äù

Because of her extremism, she knows almost nothing of me and my life. I provide her with very little information about my life. Could we be closer? Absolutely! Yet we will never be close because she is a very conservative and controlling person. She still cannot stand that I pushed away after she attempted to arrange whom I marry. I was the first one in my entire family to marry someone not my nationality or my culture. I married an American and I have been incredibly happy married to a none religious man. He is not sexist like all of the extreme old school Christian man from my birth country. Like, why the hell would I want that for myself??¬†

Continue fighting for your independence and freedom. You should concentrate on getting yourself educated for a good job. Not studying done ancient texts that means nothing to you.

If money is an issue and you want to handle it correctly between you two, then you need to decide how many times each one should visit the other. balance it (like twice a week for each one) and any extra visits should be divided between you two (if you visit him one extra time, he benefits from it too, so each one pays half the trip).",8,1736329382.0,1hwg1mq

Maybe maybe, whatever, guys will bend over backwards and make absolute Fools of themselves if they really want to see someone.  He's obviously not in that headspace anymore.

You don't have to tip toe around this - his behaviour was deliberately provocative - of Course he knows his ask for $gas was unreasonable - that's Why he asked it. And seriously, that disingenuous response ""you should have asked"" when you brought up that you'd driven to His unquestioningly and took the gas hit because that's what you do for someone you love...really low rent of him and beneath you to be on the receiving end of it. 

Take charge of yourself, be sanguine, if he doesn't respond just text him saying you're dumping him and his stuff is in bags on the lawn.

My 20(F) Boyfriend 23(M) have been dating seriously for about 6 months now.He lives about an hour away from me which was never a problem in the past when we have drove to see each other. Recently he has been working a lot and has been asking if I could drive to his place more frequently, because he is usually very exhausted as he works a very physically demanding job. Me, wanting to be an understanding girlfriend, has had zero problem with driving to see him, as he is truly my favorite person and I love seeing him. Side note, neither of us are financially unstable, we both have great paying jobs and both have willingly supportive families if we ever needed help. I think I drive to his place far more often and I have never had a problem with the drive taking up all my gas, unless there is massive amounts of traffic that causes me to be driving for almost 3 hours on the way back home. But even then, i'll just buy gas myself as I have no problem with it being wasted on him. Last week, I had a talk w/ him asking if he could possibly drive up to me this time as I had an incredibly busy few weeks ahead and would really appreciate it as we haven't seen each other in a while, since I haven't driven to see him in a minute. He agreed in a very sullen tone, that kinda irked me but I remembered that he is very consistently exhausted from work, and brushed it off. Until, yesterday, the day we agreed for him to drive up comes, and on his way to me I get a call that consisted of him complaining about how this drive took up a lot of his gas, and he said quote, ""You need to pay me gas money for this trip, for here and back."" I, being confused, asked, ""Is there a lot of traffic?"" He responded, ""No, just driving all this way has sucked up all my gas and I feel like it's only fair for you to compensate me."" I reply, ""I get that, but I've just never personally asked you for it before"". He responds, ""Well if you did, I would."" I said that we would talk about it once he gets here, trying to avoid a disagreement, but instead he decides to hang up on me and I guess turns around. I check our shared life360 about 30 minutes later when he was supposed to get to my house, and it shows him already almost back at his house. I tried to call him multiple times, but he only texted me that I was being unfair and ridiculous. AITA?

If his gf came out to our place he paid for her gas both ways. But she doesn't like to drive out here because she doesnt like to drive, and we dont have malls or fast food within 28 miles. So it was completely one sided, and she never paid for fuel or the AirBnB when he went there.

That said, a couple of things you said in your post indicate a very uneven set of spending patterns for people who are - let's face it - barely scraping by:

1. Feeding dogs should NEVER cost 7/10 what it takes to feed 3 humans. I'm referring to your original grocery plan here and not the expanded generous version. Something is imbalanced in that math. Maybe you were buying dog food for a month and people food for a week, but it doesn't add up. You can't afford to pay that much to feed dogs.

2. What kind of jackass making $400 a week, claiming he can't afford food, bitching about the food his roommate buys for the house also has three consoles? Whaaaat the fuck? If you make that little money the only way you should be able to pay for gaming consoles and games is if you live in your parents house rent free and they feed you.

All of these financial problems seem like remnants of childhood that don't match what your current adult financial situation can support. Also, I would move the fuck out of that house.

Okay, so my grandma was selling her car and I needed one, so I offered to buy it from her. We made a deal, everything was cool, and now it‚Äôs mine.

So, AITA for just buying the car without talking to my cousin first?

She was already selling the car, not giving it away.  This was going to happen regardless of what your cousin thought.  Your cousin was never getting a free car.  The fact that it was you who bought it is irrelevant.  Cuzzo just wants to blame you.  Maybe if they put in an offer to buy it they'd have it, but you can't get mad at someone for buying what you were expecting for free.",1,1736336359.0,1hwcv51

You should also call Adult Protective Services and make them aware of her health, the animals, and the conditions (animal feces) in the home.¬† Explain that Nancy is due to be discharged, doesn't have adequate care at home, and that her home could have biohazard issues.


If Nancy doesn't have paid staff to care for the animals, you might also call Animal Welfare, explain the situation, and ask them to look into the care of the animals.

My (F69)friend of over 30 years, let‚Äôs call her Nancy is almost 80. She had a stroke last Friday. She had surgery and the plan is to release her to her home in 2 days. 

I just found out that she has told the hospital that her friends, primarily me are going to serve as caregivers. This is an obligation I am unwilling to take on. I am recently retired and taking care of a 95yo FIL. 

My friend can be difficult and is prone to weaving a pretty story to cover her reality. For example, she lives on a small farm and is fond of letting livestock roam through the house dropping manure as they go. She won‚Äôt accept this as a problem. 

I have a guest room but it‚Äôs upstairs and will be inaccessible to her in her current condition. She is telling her caseworker that she has help that realistically will not be there for her. I‚Äôm ready to tell the caseworker that she is being lied to. My intent is to preserve the health and safety of my friend but I doubt she will see it that way.

Ideally, the caseworker should be confirming with people that her patients reference to ensure accuracy.

But you absolutely need to ensure that the caseworker knows that 1. You are not in a position to care for Nancy 2. Nancy cannot live in your home and 3. Nancy‚Äôs home is not, uh, sanitary and is likely to run off any caretakers. Realistically, Nancy likely needs to find new homes for her livestock unless she has the money and personnel to continue caring for the livestock OUTSIDE of her home, as livestock. If she has dogs or cats that are trainable, that‚Äôs one thing. But a cow wandering through her living room, pooping everywhere is not a good situation.

She is now 97, lives on the third floor with no elevator, and is now permanently stuck in her apartment alone. My parent's can't force her to leave because she is mentally incapacitated (yet) so they go to her thrice a week and are essentially waiting for government assistance to refuse to care for her due to her situation being too difficult so she can be moved to an elderly home and cared for.

The best thing to do for your friend is say No immediately and firmly. Be there for her in all the ways that aren't related to caring for her. But some people will not accept the reality of aging until they are forced to and even then some would rather die. Some people would rather die surrounded by memories of good times than live alone in an elderly home they have no attachments to. Show (don't tell, show) her the help she will actually have available, and then let her make her own decision, her life and death is hers to choose as she sees fit. Better she faces reality now while she can still plan the sunset of her life to be the way she wants it.

But make sure to say no immediately and firmly. The slope into being guilted to care for someone who won't care for themselves is very slippery.

EDIT: Saw that the health officers must trust her word. This is true in most countries and 100% expected. Legally she is still able to make her own decisions so there will be nothing she can do. As horrible as it may sounds, people in most countries are free to live and die as they choose. She can deny help and care all she wants as long as she is not mentally incapacitated.

To be perfectly clear what you can expect: She is going to use the threat and guilt of her own death to pressure others to care for her the way she wants. Your only options are yes or no.

For example: let‚Äôs say that despite all your troubles, you never have an issue misfiling something. Then, one day, you accidentally read the wrong label on a file and put it in the wrong place. The solution here is on you: you can read the correct label next time, so, ultimately everything can continue running on as is. You will be forgiven. So when you explain what happened, it‚Äôs accepted as a valid reason.

But let‚Äôs say you have an issue with verbal instructions and cannot remember all the steps of a task unless your manager writes the steps down (or patiently allows you to write them down as they speak.) The solution here is now on the neurotypical person: they have to change THEIR behaviour to accommodate YOU. 

**And they find that fucking offensive.**

So they resist, they say ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs **just an excuse** if you can‚Äôt do it my way then you‚Äôre the problem.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs the difference between a ‚Äúreason‚Äù and an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù to someone who doesn‚Äôt have neurodivergence. We are used to people telling us our whole lives that we have to change our behaviours to make others comfortable, but when neurotypical people hear it said to themselves for the first time they get extremely defensive and self victimize and gaslight.",1,1736350174.0,1hwbrfz

I struggle with trauma and mental health issues, including ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD, which affect my work. I communicate openly with my boss and coworkers about my challenges. I have a shorter schedule and take breaks to manage overwhelm.

In December, I flipped my schedule with a coworker to cover understaffing, but I've missed only 2 days due to illness, while she has missed a lot more. Recently, two coworkers from another department confronted me about my breaks and claimed I'm not a team player. I feel I work hard within my limits and prioritize my mental health over the unrealistic expectations of others who push themselves too hard.

I don't understand why my choices affect them. I focus on doing my job and going home, but some think I'm selfish. AITA?

I bought my girlfriend an all expenses paid trip to Portugal for her birthday.  This included first class airfare, all tours, hotels, meals, rental car, train travel, etc. for two weeks.  This cost me over $12,000.  It cost her nothing except for personal items she decided to purchase on the trip.  A few months later, I rented an apartment in Lisbon for a month for my daughter and her friends so they could have a base from which to experience the country.  My girlfriend then complained to me that her birthday trip was not special because I ""did the same thing"" for my daughter, that I spoil my kids, and that she never wanted to go to Portugal in the first place.  She also told me that she had discussed all this with her friends and they agreed with her.  Am I really the asshole here?

With a friend in her late 30's behaving this way, you really should exercise caution altogether.

Her actions after are interesting. I would like to point out - she did ask first, vs. Just having him over, so there is that.

But, doesn't cancel the rest. Hearing no is hard, and she possibly wasn't sure how to say this to him. And, might not be totally telling herself the truth as to why she's back with him.

Last winter (2023) my BFF (38F) had a scary incident with her then BF of several months on the way to a  shared office party. I (36F) started receiving messages from my BFF that said she was afraid to be in the car with her BF as he was freaking out while driving, yelling at her, etc. My wife (31F) and myself of course panicked and turned around to go get her. Luckily my BFF was not harmed, but it was not very clear as to what was actually happening, to be honest, it was just scary. She told him he had to leave by the time she was back from the party, which he did. After, I understood from my BFF that they had broken up and he had gone into outpatient therapy. 

Fast forward about a year, my wife planned a surprise vacation for the both of us. My wife asked my BFF if she would be willing to stay at our house for the week that we would be gone in order to watch our animals. Note: my wife asked her before she booked anything. Shortly after asking, my BFF responded ""Hi girl, sure I can help out, what a sweet idea!"" After some messaging they agreed on the dates, with no issues brought up.

Fast forward 1.5 weeks before we were to leave, my BFF is over and she asked us if her mom and niece could come over and hang out while she was watching our house. We said no problem! She then casually dropped that she and her (ex) BF had met up recently and were ""kind of"" dating. Wife and I were surprised, which we also gently made clear to her. She brushed off our concerns and didn't really engage.

A few days afterwards, my BFF sent me a voice message asking if I would be okay with it if her BF stayed over at our home with her for a couple of days. I was shocked and upset. I got back to my her saying that while her family was totally fine, we were not comfortable with him being in our home while we were away. She defended him by saying he's totally fine now and what happened during the incident is unusual and not the norm. I said that's fine, but we had not seen him since then, and it felt strange to have him in our home when we thought he had been out of the picture for almost a year due to his actions. She pushed back by telling my wife that she hadn't even wanted to stay at our house, it was annoying and out of the way for her. My BFF then suggested that all four of us meet up for dinner before we leave on the trip, so that we can reconnect with her BF. We said we were happy to meet up, but that we would also look for another solution. She pressured us into letting her know asap. My wife and I were very lucky that her parents were in town visiting for several weeks, and they were happy to stay over at our house during our trip. We communicated this to my BFF and waited for an invite to meet her up with her and her BF. That never came - in fact, there was radio silence.

I have since reached out to her to try to talk things out, but Reddit, AITA?

My family surprised me with a week-long trip to FL for my 30th birthday. I invited my boyfriend, who paid for our flights as my birthday gift. My dad covered the rest. Leading up to the trip, my boyfriend didn‚Äôt help plan anything and kept procrastinating on booking flights until I had to handle it myself. For his birthday (right before mine), I took him to a $300 dinner, bought him a new TV, and decorated for him. While I don‚Äôt usually compare, this context matters.

Before the vacation, we argued over the holidays because I had to buy all his family‚Äôs Christmas gifts, and he wasn‚Äôt appreciative. It made me question inviting him, but I felt guilty excluding him.

The second day in FL, he stubbed his toe on my foot while I was stretching and blamed me, even though he walked into me. He sulked about it all day, complaining in front of my mom and grandma. At the beach, he kept saying his toe was broken. When I told him it wasn‚Äôt, he snapped at me in front of my family. Frustrated, I walked ahead to calm down. I was wrong in this situation.

Later, he overheard my mom and grandma saying they didn‚Äôt want to hear us bickering all week. He took it as them bad-mouthing him and accused me of trying to make him look bad in front of my family. After that, he drank heavily at the beach and became tipsy.

On the way to dinner, I joked about him slurring his words, but he got upset, claiming I was embarrassing him. At the restaurant, he blew up on me, saying he couldn‚Äôt wait to make me look bad in front of his family. He later realized he‚Äôd lost his shorts, blamed me for it, and slammed the car doors and trunk, upsetting my grandma.

At Walmart, he yelled at me for 20 minutes, complaining about splitting $500 for my dogs‚Äô care (even though I refunded him $250) and resenting that he bought my flight, which was supposed to be a birthday gift. He also criticized my dog‚Äôs behavior after it chewed his boot, called me poorly trained, and said I‚Äôd be lucky to find someone willing to put up with me or my dog.

In the Walmart parking lot, I yelled at him to go home after he followed me out of the car and wouldn‚Äôt give me space. He said he‚Äôd leave, cancel the dog care arrangement, and take the $500 I gave him.

That night, he sulked in the bedroom while I cried in another room. The tension caused issues with my family. The next morning, he acted like nothing happened, didn‚Äôt apologize, and still blamed me. Now, I‚Äôm questioning if this relationship is worth saving or if it‚Äôs time to walk away.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I made a comment about my friend's breakup that clearly hurt her, and in front of our friends, even though it could be true. I might be the asshole for not talking to her about this in private and being a little more tactful, and this also caused tension in our friend group which I could've avoided.

Drunk minds speak sober thoughts. She meant it. You know she meant it. She just didn't want the consequences that came with it. She has been sexually harassing your husband for a long time. If you sit down and really talk to your husband, you may be surprised by how extremely uncomfortable he has been with Kira's behaviour for a long time, but that he has kept his mouth shut to preserve your friendship.

The truth is that your friendship is over. She has been making plays for your husband in despicable ways, and if he took her up on the offer, she wouldn't have given you a second thought. It's up to you to protect your marriage and your husband from people like this. She has successfully manipulated you into allowing this BS for years. Enough is enough. A true friend would never behave this way.

And for the record, you didn't ""steal"" anything. Your husband is a person, not a possession. Kira is treating him like an object, a prize to be won. He's not. You asking if she was OK with you dating a man she'd never dated or had any claim over was respectful of your friendship, but it also played into the idea that she had a right to him first.

I 20 F had my birthday in October of last year. And sometime in November I was casually messaging / chatting with my aunt. Who is my the wife of my mom‚Äôs brother. At one point in our conversation she mentioned how she sent me some things for my birthday and how she is sorry it is late. I thanked her and told her she didn‚Äôt need to get me anything. She also mentioned how she shipped the items to house. After seeing this I thought when I go home for thanksgiving I should see a package at home for me. Upon arriving home I didn‚Äôt see anything and neither did my parents. I thought nothing of it and thought it would be reach by Christmas break. When I get home there was nothing. My mom mentioned back during thanksgiving not to mention anything which I didn‚Äôt. And as well during the first couple days of Christmas break. It is now January I decided this is super weird and it should‚Äôve gotten here by now. So after consulting one of my friends I decided to let her know.

Upon asking my uncle and checking Amazon order history she told me she ordered some clothes and a DoorDash gift card however the DoorDash gift card couldn‚Äôt be shipped to my city which is why whole thing never sent. So she apologize and said she will send the clothes and Amazon gift card instead. This morning before I woke up a package came in my mom‚Äôs name and she opened it and saw Amazon gift card for me. She got mad at me for letting my aunt know. And said if it never came that means they never sent anything. And how I was basically asking for a gift. And if I wanted something I could‚Äôve asked my parents to order it for me / they would have gave me money to order it. And that I need to somehow return the gift card. Was wondering what I shd say when the clothes come and AITA?

INFO:

1. How long did you expect the appointment to take?
2. Was your husband informed about how long it should/could take?
3. At what point during the 7 hour experience did you realize the stylist went off script, and did you communicate with your husband.?

I'm not of similar descent, so I don't know how long a hair appointment for your hair specifically should take, but if my partner were to go out for an appointment, and not come back for *7 hours* unexpectedly in the middle of our vacation, I'd be pissed too. 

However, whether or not you're TA i dependent upon:

1. Whether he was informed about the approx/potential appointment length, and was fine with you taking time away to do that.
2. To what extent you communicated with him when things went awry.

If you spent that chunk a time away, *unexpectedly*; and *left him in the dark*, then Y T A. If the roles were reversed and he ditched you for 7 hours for a single ""appointment"" without a heads up, I imagine you'd be disappointed too.

If you spent that chunk of time away, *expectedly*; and *communicated when things went awry*, then you're  N T A. In this case he would have known what was going on, and that something happened beyond your control that caused the time to be extended.

It's fair for your husband to be disappointed that he lost out on a significant amount of your vacation together. Unexpected ish happens sometimes, so he'll have to get over that, but whether or not that issue is on you depends upon what happened before and during the 7 hour period.

>We still have three days left and I'm not sure how it going to go. Right now I just feel like I can't do anything right.

If you made a mistake own it, it's ok. One mistake doesn't mean you ""can't do anything right,"" even a big one. If this was on you, be more thoughtful in the future; if it wasn't, then it's on your husband to refrain from punishing you for circumstances beyond your control. 

Either way, as frustrating as the situation might be, it's not worth souring the remainder of your vacation.",-9,1736281295.0,1hw090m

Long story short, I've recently moved to Saudi Arabia with my husband. For context as this will be required to fully understand the importance, I'm Afro Caribbean with kinky curly hair. 

Our move from Toronto to Saudi was abrupt. I had very little time to get any affairs in order. Moving to Saudi is a huge life change. I had spoken to my husband before about my worries and queries as I have lived there before. One of my queries was the lack of Afro salons and hair care. 

Once moved, I had a very hard time finding someone who was well versed in Afro ha√Ør, that also would not cause any damage if given the opportunity to style it. 


Moving the main part of the story. We took a 5 day vacation to Dubai and prior to leaving I asked if it was okay if I booked an appointment to get my hair done down there as culturally there are much more stylist available who can provide healthy hair care. It will also allow me more time to see if I can eventually find someone where we live in Saudi. But honestly, it's been rough. No real social media presence or anything pops up during my Google searches. However, one quick hashtag for Dubai and honestly, so many businesses popped up. 



Anyways, hubby said it should be fine. I go to my appointment early in the morning, on time. The stylist is late to open the shop and then did a style that takes a lot longer than what I requested. I leave after being there for 7 hours. Get back to the Airbnb and hubby is furious with me. Saying half the day is gone and I'm ruining the vacation. Then tells me he is not in the to do anything for the rest of the evening. Bear in mind it's 6:30pm and there's still a million things we can do. 

For the rest of this evening he has completely ignored me. And made me feel as though I've ruined the entire vacation because of how long it took the stylist to do my hair. We still have three days left and I'm not sure how it going to go. Right now I just feel like I can't do anything right.

I (27M) got a horrible black eye right before Thanksgiving when I hit my eye after slipping in the shower.  It was so bad that called out of work the morning it happened and ended up working from home for the entire next week because my eye was ""gross"" as my girlfriend described it and my job can be done out of my house, though I hate doing so unless I have to.

After about 10 days and my eye nowhere close to healing (and after a follow-up appointment with a doctor who told me to expect my shiner to last at least until the new year), I went back to work.  I initially did so with an eyepatch, but after showing my eye about half a dozen times to people who asked about the patch, I just took it off and rolled with it.

As you can imagine, this came with a ton of questions from my coworkers about how it happened.  While I was initially vague about what happened (the truth of which I found to be a bit embarrassing), I began to craft increasingly heroic (though I believed to be obviously false) tales of how I had gotten my black eye.

I told some people that I had saved my girlfriend from a grizzly bear.  I told others that I had been hit by a falling beam saving orphans from a fire.  And others still that I had been wounded in action in a covert operation trying to take out Putin (a personal favorite which usually drew some chuckles).

It was all in good fun and has made the fact that I have been walking around looking like a half panda for 6 weeks and counting slightly more bearable.

Well, we had a new girl start at my work earlier this week and after she met me, she asked what happened.  Trying to make her part of the inside joke, I used the Putin story, which she seemed perplexed by.  I clarified right after that I was only kidding, and she responded that I shouldn't make up ""lies"" like that because she has cousins fighting in Ukraine and my story was basically stolen valor.

I just kind of walked away, but when I talked to a few of my coworkers about it, they told me I should have just told her what actually happened.  I don't think I've done anything wrong here, but I clearly have upset her a bit.  AITA?

Be very honest about how you gave lower rent bc you knew she was struggling but now you realize it was a bit too generous and you are struggling without the extra income.

Your sister‚Äôs preferences are not your problem and I would let her know so.  The only reason she is able to work part time is because you do not charge her the rent that you could charge for where she lives.  Your circumstances have changed.  Therefore, you can no longer help support her as you have been doing.  The rent is going up as of (date). 

If she complains, tell her you are sorry, but it is not your job to support her family.  And you are still not charging for rent what you legally could.  She has a couple of choices, work full time and pay the rent or seek other accommodations.",22,1736344393.0,1hwhd8t

m61j02u,WhereWeretheAdults,"NAH. This is a difficult position for several reasons. Just like you and your fianc√©, your sister has made work-life decisions based upon her current circumstances. You increasing the rent will affect those circumstances. Yes, that is a her problem, but something to consider.

Second, remove the current BF out of the question. Sister is not getting any additional benefit from an increase in rent. She has the same space as before. The other commenters arguing she should pay more just because of BF are not, IMHO, correct. How she and BF cover expenses are their business, but I don't see justification in raising the rent just because another person lives there. You might justify it as additional wear-and-tear on the property, but that isn't a large increase as that typically translates to things like new paint and maybe replacing the carpet or something a year earlier than expected.

Third, this is a two-party decision. You state you own the property with your mother. That automatically gives mother input into the decision as part owner.

I think the real question underlying this is are you subsidizing sister's rent? What I mean is does her rent cover the costs you incur for housing her? This includes things like mortgage, taxes, etc. If the answer is no, then I think you are well within reason to increase her rent to cover these costs as you are no longer in a position of subsidizing her without hurting yourself financially.

If the answer is yes, rent does cover the costs, then tread carefully. What you are considering then is increasing your sister's rent to improve your own standard of living. I'm not saying good or bad here. You will need to approach this carefully given the family dynamics in play and the fact that your mother is co-owner with you. 

I would think the first step is to discuss this with your mother. If you are subsidizing sister, then I would approach it from that standpoint. Leave current BF out of the discussion and just focus on the changes in your situation and you can no longer afford to have sister live below costs. If you are not subsidizing sister, you can still have the discussion with your mother, but you have a weaker argument.",5,1736341155.0,1hwhd8t

I, 34F, currently coown a property with my mother, 71F. We reside in the main house together along with my son,1.5M, and fianc√©, 31M. 

My sister, 38F, rents our granny flat on our property with her two kids, 9M, and, 16F.  My sister is divorced and gets minimal support from her ex husband and daughter's dad so it has fallen mostly on our mother to help out (which she will always do). Our mother specifically asked if we could build the granny flat for my sister to rent as she was struggling to pay rent and general living costs. 

While I was on maternity leave my partner was made redundant and as my normal salary is higher than his wage we decided it was best he stays with the baby for three days and work while the baby is in daycare for the other two days. Without two complete incomes it is tight, but manageable as it is only temporary and I do feel like one of us needs to be with our son as he is still so young.

Over the past few months, I have started to feel the pressure abit as costs have continued to grow. We are looking at (reluctantly) increasing baby's daycare days and my partner taking work on the weekends as we are looking to get married soon.

Meanwhile, my sister is living in the brand new 3bdrm granny flat which she pays 50% below rental value. I didn't mind this arrangement as she was struggling but about 2 months after moving in she told us she's moving to part-time work as she prefers the work/life balance over the extra income. But my actual issue is that her boyfriend, 27M, of 6mths has moved in who works full-time and while I don't mind helping out this was an arrangement we made as she was struggling but now has some other help.

Some context to start out: I‚Äôm self employed and occasionally do work for my friend and his girlfriend (they‚Äôre not married but I‚Äôll say MIL to keep it simple). They have 4 young kids together.

I‚Äôll be referring to my friend as ‚ÄúF‚Äù and his girlfriend as ‚ÄúG‚Äù.

Ok, here‚Äôs what happened:

I was working and get a voice message from G saying that she‚Äôs at the hospital with one of the kids because he‚Äôs having seizures and tells me that if I have any questions about the job I‚Äôm on, to message F instead.

(Turns out F is also at the hospital but I wasn‚Äôt told this. This‚Äôll be important later)

I drive past their house and see that F‚Äôs van is on the driveway and think to myself ‚Äúoh, F is home, he must be looking after the 3 other kids while G is at the hospital‚Äù

A short while later I get a message from F asking me to call him. I‚Äôm about to stop at their house to pick-up something off the driveway that I need for the job so I think ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm stopping at their‚Äôs anyway, I‚Äôll just talk to F then instead of calling‚Äù (I was less than a minute from their house).

So I pull up and walk into the house and F‚Äôs MIL is in the living room with the kids (I‚Äôm very familiar with MIL, she‚Äôs a friend of my parents since before I was born).

I ask ‚Äúis F home?‚Äù

And she says ‚Äúno‚Äù

I say ‚Äúoh ok, nevermind. I‚Äôll just call him‚Äù

She says ‚Äúwhy? You can tell me.‚Äù

(Remember F asked me to call him, I don‚Äôt know what he wants to talk to me about)

I say ‚Äúit‚Äôs probably just work stuff‚Äù

Then out of nowhere she speaking very angrily at me, almost shouting and says ‚Äúwhy won‚Äôt you just tell me?! F and G don‚Äôt need this stress when [kid‚Äôs name] is in the hospital! They don‚Äôt need this shit and I don‚Äôt need to deal with your attitude!‚Äù

I just say (I‚Äôm still talking normally btw) ‚ÄúF asked me to call him, I didn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs at the hospital too, I thought he was home‚Äù

She‚Äôs standing right in front of me now with a face like thunder and shouts ‚ÄúGO ON THEN CALL HIM! CALL HIM! CALL HIM THEN!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt say anything, I just look at her like ‚Äúwhat the fuck are you on about?‚Äù

I walk out the front door and she slams it hard behind me and I just say ‚Äúyou fucking bitch‚Äù

She then opens the door again and says ‚Äúwhat did you say?‚Äù

I said ‚ÄúI called you a fucking bitch‚Äù

She then calls me a dickhead and a few other insults are throw. I pick up the thing I needed from the driveway and leave.

I call F and tell him his MIL just had a go at me and I explain what happened. (Guess what: the stuff he wanted to talk to me about was in fact just work stuff)

I also explained what happened to G and she hasn‚Äôt responded. I‚Äôve also been taken off the work van insurance (it‚Äôs in G‚Äôs dad‚Äôs name) and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs just it now.

Looking back I guess she‚Äôs stressed about one of her grandkids being in the hospital but that‚Äôs no reason to blow up on me like that over nothing.

Hi! I need some perspective on a situation that happened last night.

Since I started studying medicine, a big part of my life revolves around getting good grades. When things don‚Äôt go well academically, it often triggers panic attacks and leaves me feeling like a failure because of the pressure I put on myself and the expectations I feel from others.

Yesterday, I was discussing an exam I took earlier in the day with my parents at the dinner table. I already knew it hadn‚Äôt gone well. My mom, who is a nurse, often chimes in about how things work in practice when we talk about medical topics. As we went over the exam, she pointed out more and more things that I realized I had answered incorrectly. The more she spoke, the more the reality sank in that I had likely failed the exam.

I started to feel panicked and asked if we could change the subject because it was making me feel worse. My mom responded by saying, *""If you don‚Äôt want to talk about exams, don‚Äôt bring them up in the first place.""* I replied that it was fine at first, but now it was becoming too much for me to handle, and I didn‚Äôt want to continue the conversation. This escalated into a back-and-forth, during which my mom said, *""Don‚Äôt talk about your feelings if you don‚Äôt want a response.""*

This really upset me because it‚Äôs not the first time she has said something like this. She‚Äôs often mentioned that feelings don‚Äôt always need to be shared if you don‚Äôt want to hear what others think about them. For me, this feels dismissive, especially since I‚Äôve been working on my mental health with professional help this past semester. Comments like that make me feel invalidated.

My dad eventually got involved and sided with me, but in the heat of the argument, I ended up yelling, *""If you want a shallow child like my brother who doesn‚Äôt talk about their feelings, keep doing what you‚Äôre doing!""*

To be clear, I don‚Äôt actually think my brother is shallow. He‚Äôs not. He just doesn‚Äôt feel the same need to discuss his emotions with our family as I do, and that‚Äôs okay. But in that moment, I lashed out because I wanted to make my mom understand how much it hurts when she dismisses or invalidates my feelings.

Now, I feel terrible for bringing my brother into the argument and calling him shallow, even though my intention was to highlight how I feel treated differently. I know I said it to hurt, which wasn‚Äôt fair.

Apologizing isn‚Äôt really a thing in our household‚Äîwe tend to sweep things under the rug and pretend nothing happened. I don‚Äôt like that approach, but I‚Äôm unsure if I should take the first step and apologize to my mom for yelling and bringing my brother into it, or if she should apologize first for invalidating my feelings. Part of me feels like it‚Äôs always me who has to make the first move, and I‚Äôm tired of it.

So, Reddit, AITA for yelling that my brother is shallow during this argument with my mom? And whose responsibility is it to take the first step here?

I would challenge the status quo.  Until your Mum sees that there are different ways to being heard she won't understand what you need.  I'm sure she loves you and thinks she's supporting you in the way that she's speaking to you.  Show her that it's actually having the opposite effect and she'll probably be horrified.  But you won't know unless you try.  Approach her, explain what you were feeling in that moment, then speak to your brother.   Try to deal with this in a way that makes you feel like you've really helped your family to change how they deal with these issues, and by no longer sweeping them under the carpet so that no one feels heard.",1,1736350631.0,1hwleiq

Okay so this morning our new neighbors for the third day in a row, have been hosting some sort of worship group with a piano and singing, starting at like 7 am and going until the evening, for more context... I finally went up there and rang bell, here is how the exchange went. 
Me ""hello can you guys please keep it down?""
Neighbor ""oh hello"" .... creepily smiles at me 0 self awareness literally on her front stoop in her underwear, I proceeded to say ""it's shaking our walls and all our photos.. we live just below you"" guess I caught a bit of a tone with her cause she said ""WELL IF YOU WANTED TO HAVE A NICE CONVERSATION..."" I INSTANTLY CUT HER OFF, ""no it's 8 am I don't care to chat, and plus you're outside in your underwear.."" I started to walk away and she kept calling after me ""can we talk about this""  GIRL WHAT IS THERE TO CHAT ABOUT OH MY GOD. So I stupidly and hilariously replied "" this is me being nice, I came and rang your bell instead of calling the landlord who by the way, is the grandfather of my child yea we KINDA OWN THIS HOUSE!! LOL WHY DID I SAY THAT. 
UGH I feel bad. AITA?

Hi. This did not happen in the US, but in Brazil, where our currency is R$. For reference, the minimum wage in Brazil is R$1518. 

My(20F) brother(34M) texted me to ask for R$280. He said they needed it for food. He said he was going to give it back at the end of the month but I doubted it LOL but I still gave him the money. 

like 5 minutes after I send him the money, my SIL (26F) sends me an audio where she asks me to please not lend money to my brother again and asks for my info to send the money back. I ask if she‚Äôs sure and she says yes, that you shouldn‚Äôt borrow money but earn it and they had it, they just needed to figure out the finances. I didn‚Äôt know what to do because like what if they really needed it but I ended up sending her my info because she sounded upset and got the money back

So, I told the situation to dad (66M), who I live with, because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and he‚Äôs usually chill so I didn‚Äôt think it would be a big deal, and my brother is always asking for money so it wasn‚Äôt like it was news. My dad got super upset because he had borrowed R$5.000 to him last week. 

I don‚Äôt know exactly what they did but in just an hour it went down and my brother called me to call me a bitch who told on him to dad. I feel a bit bad because maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have said anything but I didn‚Äôt know dad was going to get mad. AITA?

A close friend wants to celebrate his birthday by going out to dinner.  

He‚Äôs chosen a pricey restaurant, so I expect the bill to be high. The last time he organized dinner, the bill was close to $500 for 3 people (he likes his booze and exotic cocktails).

I am frugal and I‚Äôd rather spend my money traveling or saving for retirement. My friend blows through money and carries a lot of credit card debt.

I don‚Äôt even spend that kind of money eating out, so I am rather upset he‚Äôs chosen to do this.

What‚Äôs even more annoying is I know he expects his friends to pick up his tab and split it as a gift.

My boyfriend is currently renting a room with an air mattress that popped a couple of months ago, so he‚Äôs been sleeping on the floor. I told him he should let his landlord know, but he insists it‚Äôs not a big deal to him. I‚Äôm worried about his back and think he should at least ask for a replacement since the bed is part of the room.

Yesterday, while we were on call with my mom, I mentioned the situation. My mom expressed concern and said he should get a new mattress. I told her that I‚Äôd already mentioned it to him, but he didn‚Äôt mind, and we moved on. Today, I told my boyfriend that I‚Äôd shared this with my mom, and he got upset, calling me crazy multiple times. He said I talk to my mom too much and that I shouldn‚Äôt have shared that with her. He was in disbelief that I had the audacity to share that with her and told me that of all the things I tell my mom about him, I tell her about this. 

I felt confused because I don‚Äôt think I overshare with my mom, but I realize he might be embarrassed or feel like I overstepped a boundary. I apologized, but he didn‚Äôt accept it, just repeating that I was crazy and I should‚Äôve told my mom the situation wasn‚Äôt a problem for him. I really am sorry and I‚Äôm going through so many thoughts that could explain why he‚Äôs upset and it makes me feel terrible for doing that to him. I did tell him though I would appreciate it if, next time, he could communicate why something upset him instead of calling me crazy.

I really had no bad intentions when telling my mom. I did it more of to explain how I felt bad that my boyfriend has to sleep on the floor. There was no intentions behind what I was trying to say. I just wish he would explain to me himself though instead of me trying to figure out myself. I want to talk with him to understand what I did wrong. Unless this is something I should‚Äôve known not to mention to my mom in the first place.

For some men it's important that their partner's family have a positive image of them as in control of their lives and reasonably successful, and a worthwhile partner for their daughter.

I remember years ago my GF casually mentioned me being ""on shit money"" at a dinner with her family, I think it was out of a mix of trying to express empathy (I was at an employer that underpaid) but also frustration at our circumstances - I think we weren't able to go on the holidays we wanted to. 

Her family are all fairly comfortable and retired after decent careers, it's important to me that they think I'm a decent partner to her, and I was embarrassed and hurt that she would be so indiscrete and blunt about something that I was already deeply insecure about (I grew up poor and was only just starting to progress my career at the time) when there was no need to share that particular detail.

I am sorry I know you were worried about you back. You were sharing it out of concern but your BF is going into crazy overdrive because he is embarrassed. 

Boys are brought up with the mentality that men are supposed to be providers, men are not supposed to be weak, blah blah blah. He shared his issues with you. He was vulnerable with you. You shared it with your mom. He is not ok being vulnerable with your mom yet. Down the line, many years later maybe..not yet.

For future, anything that he shares with you, stays with you. If it is to be shared with anyone else, he will share himself. Never share your partner's stories ever with anyone (family or friends) or they will stop sharing with you.",-14,1736336946.0,1hwfcrp

Everyone wants the parents of their partner to think highly of them, he may feel like you set him up to fail with your parents. Don't forget that men have immense societal pressure around being able to provide, some cultures more intensely than others, that directly ties to their self-worth.

A massive generalization, but often times men don't have deep personal conversations or ask probing questions of their friends going through hard times the way women do. It can feel invasive and nosey to them. He may not understand that this is just normal for you.

 > Breaking my lease and leaving my roommate to find her own housing when I agreed to live with her until at least August. This would be extremely difficult for her financially, and my friends say since she would not be able to find a different apartment to rent I'd essentially be leaving her high and dry over her pet being home alone which she already tried to make right. Since she already tried to make it ok, and I still want to break my lease, I feel I could be the asshole.

But

I don't think it's worth breaking your lease over, really.  I'd not renew with her, but breaking the lease early is pretty extreme.   She is replacing your shoes, and doesn't do anything else horrendous.   You don't mesh, but we can all manage politeness with those we don't mesh perfectly.   I haven't heard anything that can't be lived with until August and it gives you more time to find another roommate and decide who stays in this apt and who goes.

Cats aren't like dogs.  Some cats are more social than others.  One college friend of mine had a VERY unsociable cat.  He loved her from afar and didn't put up with anyone else.  In our years of friendship,  I saw that cat less than 6 times.  And several of those he was trapped in a carrier as we drove home for holidays.
She regularly left him home for a week or 2.  Auto feeder and water, extra litter boxes etc.  He was actually happier to be left at home than put in a carrier and driven to her parents for 6 hours.  His behavior proved this.

So it's poss the cat was completely fine with this except for the litter situation.

If you‚Äôre upset at her for how she treated the cat (fair - I‚Äôm mad about that too), this does not help that issue.  

I agree that she neglected the cat horribly. I agree that she probably planned on no cat-sitter, given the suspicious auto-feeder and request to put out extra water.  I can only imagine how bad the apartment smelled after 3 weeks of no litter box maintenance, and how anxious and upset the cat was.  You say she has been good to the pets before this.  Breaking the lease does nothing to help her learn why what she did was wrong.  But a hard conversation about expectations and animal care might help.

I‚Äôm gonna say soft YTA if you break the lease, only because it further punishes the animals involved.

My roommate Mia (24F) and I (22F) are both grad students living in a 2 bedroom apartment. She has a dog and a cat, and this winter break we both flew home to see our families. Before we left she mentioned that she was taking her dog with her but leaving the cat for what would be \~3 weeks, and a cat sitter would come by to empty the litter box and give the cat clean water. I didn't really like the idea of a stranger having the keys to our apartment since she wasn't very clear about who the cat sitter would be, but I agreed. 

Anyway, right as she was leaving for her flight she got a delivery of an automatic feeder with a camera so she could watch the cat, and since she had no time to set it up I put it together and also set out another bowl of water because she asked me to. I'm not heading back to the apartment for another weeks but Mia flew back today and sent me a text. 

Mia: ""Hey! So my cat sitters never showed up while I was gone. The cat is fine cuz she had plenty of water and food, but she did take out her anger on my shoes. Most of your shoes by the door are absolutely fine, but your white sneakers caught some gross from my surrounding shoes. I figure you‚Äôd prefer if I just replace them as opposed to trying to save them so if you send me the link and the size I‚Äôll get them here by the time you get back."" 

I really appreciate her offering to replace my shoes, but I feel like she would have known early into the 3 weeks of break that her cat sitter wasn't going to come? Also I can't imagine how the apartment smells if the cat only had one litter box and dirty water for nearly 3 weeks?? It's a little suspicious that she got the automatic feeder and asked me to put out more water so I think there's a possibility there was never a cat sitter and in that case to me it seems like animal abuse to knowingly leave your cat alone all that time. My friends said I'm overreacting and that its nice of her to make things right by replacing my shoes, but after this I don't want to live with her. 

WIBTA to want to break my lease early (it's meant to end in August) and leave her to find different living arrangements? Unlike me she has loans and inconsistent work while I get a fixed stipend for TAing. Other than this she's an alright roommate and I know it would put her in a really bad spot financially to move again. In the four months we lived together before this she cared for her pets really well so am I making a big deal out of nothing?

For background my gf(21yo) and I(22 yo) had planned a romantic getaway for Valentines Day Weekend. We were going to get and AirBNB and just have a weekend away from pets and family. This is also our first Valentine's Day together, since we've been together since last April. 

Then comes my sister who got engaged on Christmas has planned her ceremony just at the courthouse where she lives in FL. My sister and dad of course want me there and I want to be too.

I told my gf and she's extremely upset. I explained we can do it the following weekend but I really need to be there for my family. My gf at first didn't think I was upset for ruining plans or sorry that she was upset which hasn't sat right with me. AITA for wanting to reschedule plans to go see my sister get married?

Short version: Your bio dad is the asshole here, and your brothers are a bit misguided. I only say that because they think you should help him out. But I 100% get that he's their sperm donor too, so they‚Äôre probably having their own conflicting feelings about him right now.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long version of why NTA:

It sounds like you‚Äôre in a tough situation, and it‚Äôs completely understandable to feel conflicted. From what you‚Äôve described, it seems like your father hasn't been actively involved in your life, and when he did reach out, it was primarily for financial support rather than to rebuild your relationship. This pattern of behavior could understandably make you hesitant to continue giving him money, especially after he has gone silent for extended periods. I have a friend who was in the exact same scenario as you‚Äôre in now, but the difference was we were both teenagers at the time.

I'll tell you what I told her:

It‚Äôs not wrong to want to help your bio dad. I call him that because ‚Äúfather‚Äù implies he raised you or was a father figure/parent in your life, which he hasn‚Äôt been. How many times have you needed him and he hasn‚Äôt been there? How many times have you faced heartbreak because he bailed on what I believe is the bare minimum of being a parent (showing up and trying)?

You‚Äôre right to protect yourself from potentially being taken advantage of.

You‚Äôre not obligated to give money just because someone is asking, especially when the relationship doesn‚Äôt seem to be based on mutual care and effort.

But it‚Äôs also understandable that you want a connection with the person who shares half your DNA. Maybe there were times when he did show up.

I‚Äôm not going to sit here on my high horse and tell you how you should feel.

The only advice I‚Äôd give, (and that‚Äôs if you want it; feel free to tell me to take a hike), is:

**It‚Äôs important to establish boundaries that protect your well-being, both emotionally and financially**. He needs to be the one to earn your trust back, and right now, he‚Äôs not doing that.

As for your brothers, it might help to explain why you feel the way you do: that you‚Äôre willing to rebuild the relationship, but it needs to be a two-way street and not just about money. It‚Äôs your decision, and you‚Äôre not the asshole for choosing to protect yourself from a situation that feels transactional rather than genuine.

\[Sorry if any of this came across as harsh or unsympathetic. I really do empathize with you, and whatever happens, I wish the best for you and your siblings.\]

Hey everyone, 

So kind of an interesting situation. My biological father hasn‚Äôt been in my life for probably around 25 years. He was in a very physical relationship with my mother and his ex wife while they had relationships. He was arrested and deported back to Mexico when I was about 11. Haven‚Äôt heard from him at all since. 

Fast forward to 2022 I get a random email from a young lady claiming to be my 18 year old sister. She and I talked after confirming some information about each other and her siblings who I knew of since I had met them when they were toddlers. She sent my information to my dad and he‚Äôs been messaging me periodically from time to time. 

Just a few months ago he asked for $100. I felt ok sending that to him because I felt this was a step to possibly rebuild our relationship. He ghosted me for 6 months after I sent messages asking how he was, if he was ok and all that. He messaged me again today asking for more money. No response from the other messages when I sent him pictures of his granddaughters. He‚Äôs been continuously asking even after I said no. 

I explained this all to my brothers and they said I should just give him the money and that I‚Äôm being a AH for just helping him out. I feel like it‚Äôs enabling him to keep asking. I‚Äôm torn I want to help because he‚Äôs my dad, but on the other hand I don‚Äôt want to seem like a piggy bank for him.

However, I will add that you aren't exactly helping the situation by giving him ***TOO*** much attention. He's become to expect it of you, which is why he got upset when you've set boundaries. But calling him in the morning, and again in the evening is a bit much and sending the wrong message. You claim he's just a friend but I don't even give my boyfriend(s) that much attention, let alone best friends. Not sure why you've given so much time to someone who clearly just wants to chat because he's bored and you're willing to give up your time.. and that is all.

And now that he's not talking to you........ *let the trash takes itself out*, meaning let him go. Look, anyone who cannot value your free time and wants to monopolize every free waking moment you have, is ***not*** a friend. Part of friendship is being considerate of your friend's time, and this guy clearly does not value that. These types of people just end up sucking the life out of you. And what's even scarier is they don't know they are doing it and/or don't see anything wrong with doing so.  They feel they are in the right because 'they are your friend'.

I've had this happen to me a number of times... some people just do not get it. And no matter how many times you tell them ""hey, I'm busy right now"" or ""hey can I have some space"".. within a short time, they are back at it again. Or getting angry with you b/c you aren't giving them their daily attention. I've gone as far as blocking people just to get them to stop, and yes this is after repeated 'i need space' 'can you back off' warnings. It absolutely sucks to do, but doing so brought so much sanity back into my life because I didn't have this person (or persons at one point) all coming at me all the time trying to get my attention.

And if he throws a tantrum then acknowledge it but don't bend. And if he tries to parlay that into more face to face time instead it is also a no, only what you feel comfortable with which frankly should be once a week or less.

I (M34 gay) have a friend (M34 gay) who, while I appreciate his friendship and wish to keep him as a friend, has a very different idea of friendship than I do. I have made it clear I am just his friend and no more. 

I work in a field that requires me to be in constant interaction with others and I am often extremely tired after work and barely want to talk to anyone. I allow my friend to call me between 5-7 PM and talk to him until around 7. How long we talk depends how quickly he calls. I also call every morning on my drive to work. I do not know how I got in this habit but I find talking on the phone far less enjoyable and fulfilling (with anyone) than he does. He gets very easily bored and needs constant interaction and I don‚Äôt. If I kept him on the phone he would talk forever all day whereas I only call people if I have something specific to tell them and that‚Äôs it.

Today, he got angry and accused me of being selfish and bad friend for ‚Äúonly talking when it is convenient for me‚Äù but as far as I am concerned, I already am giving him far more than what is standard and expected for friendship and he should appreciate that. Then I said I am not making any exceptions to not speaking on the phone past 7, unless it is an emergency. He got angry and hung up and is ignoring me now.

But every time you call him or pick up his call, when you actually don‚Äôt want to, you kinda are. You are abandoning yourself and putting his needs ahead of your own.

It sounds like a codependent relationship. He is taking from you and you continuously give, even when you don‚Äôt want to. Why‚Äôs that? Why are you throwing all your energy into a friendship where the dynamics aren‚Äôt aligned with what you want? That‚Äôs a great way to develop massive resentment and hatred for your friend. But you are adding to the dynamic by going along with it and keeping your true feelings quiet. Every time you call and pick up the phone you are reinforcing the dynamics. 

Stick to your boundaries! I would put more in place and start thinking about what you actually want from this friendship. Because clearly talking on the phone for hours a day is not it.

So I have a friend that is a single mother to a 12 year old son with a few disabilities and impairments. He has ADHD, Autism, and he's deaf. Anywho, she allows him to walk all over her, and gives him any and everything he wants, which is fine until it becomes an inconvenience. For example, the other morning she allowed him to eat some of my ice cream for breakfast, allows him to drink everything but water; and let's him eat up all the sweet snacks.

There are countless times, I have ordered us all the same amount of food, he will rush to eat his, then eat the majority of hers too. Well tonight, I decided to order us two, 25 hot wings, because we hadn't eaten all day; but her son just ate 20-25 pizza rolls about 30 minutes before that. As I mentioned ordering, she said we could split the wings up, 8 for her, 8 for her son, and 9 for myself. I tried compromising and mentioned getting the wings without any sauce, because her son doesn't like spicy food. But last second she asked me to order a pizza, so he could eat some, and because she wanted sauce on her wings.

So instead, I ordered a salad, 10 BBQ wings for her son, and 10 hot wings for her; yet they messed up the order, and the BBQ wings never came. She then questioned me about why I didn't order a pizza, and I explained that I got him BBQ wings instead, but they clearly made a mistake. So she got mad and started going off on me, and I bluntly said ""Neither of us have eaten today, and he just ate about an hour ago. So it's not like he's going to starve to death. You need to learn that boundaries and discipline should be set in place, and he needs to learn he can't have everything he wants in life, because that's unrealistic."" Am I the asshole for setting a boundary and limiting how much he eats?

m5rlmw5,emergencycat17,"NTA.  If they wanted the seat, they should have booked it together.

This same thing happened to me on the way home from Thanksgiving at my sister's on Amtrak.  I like the window seat, so if there's one, I sit there (*and I realize this is a little different, because unless it's Amtrak business class which you can reserve, it's first come, first serve*).

It was an hour and a half train ride.  This girl and her boyfriend board the train, I'm in my window seat, and the aisle seat is empty.  Also, the aisle seat next to my aisle seat was also empty with the person next to them in the window.  So they could have sat aisle/aisle and still been next to each other.

Anyway, the girlfriend says to me, ""Excuse me - and if this isn't okay, it's fine - but would you mind finding another seat so he and I can sit together?""  I politely said, ""No, sorry, I want to sit here.""  She actually looked a little shocked.  But one of them sat next to me in the aisle, and the other one sat in the aisle seat across from us.

At the next stop, both of the people behind me got off, so the two of them quickly switched, grabbed those two, and were able to sit together.  The boyfriend sat behind me, and promptly kicked the back of my seat HARD, about three times.  Gee, what happened to ""If it's not okay, it's fine""?  I ignored him - I figured the absolute best way to retaliate was to not acknowledge his childishness that he and his lady love had to sit less than a foot away from each other till the next stop.

People are just jerks when they don't get what they want, you did nothing wrong.  You booked your seat, and just because he wanted it doesn't make him in the right.

I disagree with the comment ""they should pay for their seat in advance like everyone else"" argument. Anyone who has flown on an airplane before knows sometimes flights are changed and seats are changed regardless of having paid extra. (It happened to me and they sat my kid with a stranger even though I paid extra in advance. Luckily, the stranger was kind enough to switch with me.)Who knows why they didn't book as far in advance as you or everyone else? Maybe it was an emergency and a last minute booking.

m5rloje,Zandonah,"Just remember it may not be the parents fault either. They could very well have booked seats together and then the airline comes along and switches the plane, or just decides they want someone else to have those seats - I don't know what they do, just the end result - and the family group is now not sitting next to each other like they planned and booked. And then the family speaks to the airline ""oh it will be sorted at checkin"", at the checkin counter ""oh, the gate agent will have to deal with that for you"", then the gate agent ""the air crew need to do that as we've already printed the seating list"", and finally the poor air steward is stuck trying to find seats to put the mother back with the two toddlers that for some inexplicable reason the airline decided didn't need to be near each other.

So please - stop putting the blame always on the parents. Sure, sometimes it might be, but I've had enough experience to know that quite often it's actually the airline at fault.

This sub has a major habit of defaulting to what you‚Äôre ‚Äúrequired‚Äù or ‚Äúobligated‚Äù to do, but I think that‚Äôs a poor standard for what makes an AH.

You seem like a wholly unpleasant person to deal with, and if that‚Äôs not an AH then idk what is.

You don‚Äôt mention anything about why you, a full grown adult, needed a window seat so badly. There are plenty of good reasons to require one but your choice not to include one is conspicuous.

What you DO mention is that the flight was a measly 70 minutes, and that you wouldn‚Äôt care if you stood between the family and a 20-row gap between 3 of them and the 4th. Your lack of concern for anyone but yourself is evident.

It‚Äôs true that the father shouldn‚Äôt have tried to guilt you and could have been gracious enough to accept your first answer. It‚Äôs also true that you paid for a specific seat and fairly enforced that entitlement.

But you can be technically correct and still an AH, and this post is good evidence that this sub often forgets that basic fact. The father was right that you‚Äôre not a very nice person. Even a marginally nice person would have given some grace to parents with children. 

‚Äî And as an aside, I think it‚Äôs bonkers how many comments here are so quick to call parents ‚Äúentitled‚Äù for simply trying to leverage the LONG STANDING CULTURAL NORM of being gracious to families.

My mil, husband, and I all live together. She can't drive so I usually do everything she asks for. She told me she wanted a cat, I talked to her about cats, looked for cats for a few months until we all agreed on a really cute cat, and then we got a cat. Afterwhich She told my husband and I that she NEVER said she wanted the cat and didn't even like cats after we brought her home. We kept the cat back with us, and we do everything for her, so she's our cat. 

Now this cat is super attached to me, she's on me when I'm sleeping or awake, she stands vigil while I use the bathroom, and shes at the door as I leave and return. My husband says it's like she looks at me as her mommy, which is cute but I don't really refer to myself as mommy. However I heard my mother in law refer to herself as mommy... while my husband is referred to as daddy to the cat. 

It makes me feel a little weird. I've always felt like she has looked at me as competition, I've had to tell her before she's not married to her son I am and the way she tries to overtake my position as her sons wife gives me the ick. I have let her step on me before, trying to keep the peace, but I really don't like how it feels. 

So my question basically is, if I asked her to not refer to herself as mommy with our cat would I be the asshole?

I (20F) have moved out of my parents at 18 with my now fiance. I have three siblings. My sister is 19 rn and has been in Mexico for the past few months away at a school that is apart of my family's religion. A school that is very questionable to say the least. They make the students do a cleansing where they eat only rice for two weeks and force the students to do an enema, if they act up they get their phones taken and other things despite being adults. Plus they don't get any form of diploma or certification at the end of it.

My sister is coming to stay with me, originally for two months before moving in with my grandmother since I live in a studio and my sister doesn't want to be in such a small space with a couple which is understandable. However she told me the other day that now she wants to only stay for two weeks to go to a different school in mexico because the priest shes been staying with wants her to go to continue studying.

I'm angry to say the least. I ask her with what money because I am the one who's been paying for her phone, her meals, her clothes, supporting her this whole time to help her eventually come to the US (Shes a citizen btw).

 The pastors wife, interjects while I'm on the phone with my sister and says how the classes and everything are free, however the flight and how much I want to give for her to eat and hygiene its up to me to decide what I want to send her. WTF? They're the ones talking her into this yet they offer no help. I tell her its a waste of time she can learn here, she needs to get her GED, a bank account things so that she can eventually be independent. That its a waste of money and time since she'll get no diploma or proof that she went to any school. She argues that knowledge is more important than a piece of paper. How she'd be working for God and doing his mission. 

I tell her I'm not paying for it and she says fine then Mom will. And I ask if she seriously wants to make mom pay for it when she knows our mother is not financially responsible and has to care for our younger sister with little to no money. And that on top of everything I'm also financially supporting our mother. 

She doesn't want to hear it, she's an adult and making her own decisions. I'm an asshole for throwing money in her face and how that is all I care about. Meanwhile at the beginning of her starting at the school I spent arguing with the pastors and my mother to try and get her to be where I am because she felt uncomfortable there. And I just want her to live a normal and independent life. 

More arguing and it only resulted that she's going to visit for two weeks but at the end that she's returning to mexico. I have no idea what to do or if i'm actually in the wrong here.

m621zy6,afforkable,"I would need way more info to pass judgment on this one. I will say, as another woman diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, the way you write about it feels kind of... off. Your wife has an actual diagnosis and treatment plan, while you ""believe"" you have ADHD, but have managed to keep yourself so focused and organized that you sit on two non-profit boards and engage in all kinds of optional activities at, presumably, your full-time job. I don't know exactly what your career might be or the prestige level of these non-profit orgs, but I just have the feeling you're at least upper management.

Ehhh. Not saying it's impossible, but you give off the same vibes as the people who ask me, ""Have you tried meditation/paleo/insert their favorite diet or activity here?"" They're the same people who will be like, ""Oh, I'm totally ADHD too!"", except they mean they forget their keys once in a while.

Are you expecting that because you're able to ""get out of your comfort zone"" and ""find ways to stay focused and organized,"" your wife should be able to do the same thing? Because executive dysfunction often means you're literally unable to do that, and imposing the implicit or explicit expectation that someone should just try harder or have more discipline can be incredibly frustrating for neurodivergent people.

Also, people with ADHD often have some level of social anxiety because we're used to feeling left out, annoying, or weird when we're around neurotypical people. You say your wife knows your friends and their wives... does she even get along with them, or are you assuming she should because they're all women? Are they all neurotypical extrovert types who keep immaculate houses and love hosting and small talk? Does your wife has any friends of her own from work or whetever? What are they like?

In terms of other story details, when you say your wife complains every time your mother and sister stay over, what do you mean? Based on this post, I have no idea if her complaints are unreasonable. We've seen posts here that are like, ""My wife and my mom hate each other for no reason!"", and then it turns out one or the other or both has been *way* out of line or blatantly passive aggressive.

This girl drained him to the point that he became a sort of shell of himself. She also claimed to have severe ADHD and social anxiety that only really seemed to flare up when he wasn't paying attention to her.

When he was out with his friends, she would have panic attacks and spam text/call him until he came home. When he brought her with him to combat this, she would pout in a corner if he dared to have a conversation that didn't involve/center her, or she'd storm off and hide for half an hour.

I used to have a lot of sympathy for her until I realized that her panic attacks and stress episodes were miraculously absent as long as she was the center of attention. For instance, her birthday party went off without a single hitch until he dared to leave her (one room away!) to say hi to me and some other of our older friends. Then she was crying in the bathroom because she ""just got too anxious all of a sudden.""

m60jzkn,TakotsuboTomorrow,"Nursing is probably top three demanding of social capital. But that‚Äôs not the main issue. Bedside nursing has a way of disregulating you in general. You are working 12-14 hour shifts with your mind moving nearly as fast a your feet. Everyone has questions. Everyone needs something. Alarms, bells, changes in status, charting, calling, medications. The list is unending. After doing that for two to three days you literally have nothing left. You‚Äôre underslept, overstimulated, probably undernourished and overcaffienated. Your cortisol levels have been rising high and all you want to do is sleep and sit quietly. This is especially true for n ADHD-er, who may have a challenging time quieting things down in their mind anyway. Couple that with the fact that social anxiety often co-occurs with ADHD and voila! You have a lady without much desire to socialize.  

With that said I don‚Äôt think YTA. I think you want to socialize and include your wife. I think you want it to feel equality in the effort between you.

m61zo80,YearOneTeach,"ESH. The disparity in family visits is definitely unfair. If her dad can stay for several weeks, then she needs to be open to your family staying just as long. If she is using all her PTO for her dad‚Äôs visits, she needs to scale it back and split it evenly between the families.

I do think that you are maybe being a bit harsh on her. I think she should be working on socializing, but then you said she is a nurse and I kind of feel like maybe the issue isn‚Äôt social anxiety so much as burnout. Nursing is a very high contact and demanding job. Maybe when she comes home or has days off, the last thing she wants to do is be around yet more people.

I think it‚Äôs fair to sit down and talk about the things you want to do as a couple, and try to encourage her to meet you halfway. If the anxiety is so bad she can‚Äôt, then you should recommend therapy because it sounds like it‚Äôs impacting your life in some ways. However, calling the issue a lack of her ‚Äúadulting‚Äù is kind of insensitive and dismisses her feelings.

My (47M) wife (45F) refuses to do anything with me that involves other people.  She was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult and takes medication for it.  She also claims to have social anxiety disorder, though I'm not sure that's ever been officially diagnosed.  Any time I ask her to join me at any kind of social event, or even to just go out to dinner ourselves at a nice restaurant, she refuses, claiming she can't because of her ADHD.  If I push the issue too much, she has a fit, says ""you don't understand, I can't...I have social anxiety!"" and then sulks off and stops talking to me for the next hour or so.

Since high school, I've believed that I also have ADHD, but I've never bothered to get an official diagnosis.  I'm also extremely introverted, but I realized pretty early into my career that if I wanted to get ahead, I had to break out of my comfort zone.  I've found ways to keep myself focused and organized, and I've put myself out there by volunteering to do things like presentations and leading training sessions.  These days I can get up in front of an auditorium full off people without batting an eye (though small groups still give me some angst).

I currently serve on two non-profit boards, and a few times a year we have events where spouses are invited and, of course, I always go alone.  The only times my wife has joined me was when I was installed as president of one of those boards, when my term ended, and when I was presented an award.  My wife did attend two of my good friends' weddings, but she insisted we leave as soon as dinner was over.

On the other hand, when there is something important to my wife, I'm expected to drop everything to be there with her.  She even dragged me to her grandmother's 80th birthday party about a month after we met.  When her dad comes to visit (which he did four times last year), he stays for 2-3 weeks and I'm expected to take 2 or 3 days off from work to spent with him each time.  When my mom and sister come to visit, my wife allows them to stay for four days, tops, insists ""I can't just take time off at the last minute like you can"" (even though she knows their coming weeks or months in advance and seems to have no trouble doing it when her dad comes), does everything she can to avoid them, and complains the whole time they're here.

FWIW, my wife is a nurse, career that's got to be in the top 10 most demanding of social capital.

I know it's hard to be social when you're not used to it, so I try to be understanding, but I don't feel that my wife is trying.  I'm perfectly fine with being a homebody most of the time, but sometimes it's fun to get out and do things, and we never do.  We have no ""couples friends,"" even though my wife knows all of my closest friends and, in most cases, their wives.  I'm sick of always making excuses for why she can't make it to any of the work/org social events that I'm expected to attend, and I'm sick of the temper tantrums when I ask join me.

A lot of people use their ""diagnosis"" ( assuming she isn't actually diagnosed with social anxiety) as a carte blanche to get out of things they dislike doing. Your wife is doing this to the point that it feels that's she's not acting supportive as a partner.


It could be that her social battery is low but I find it pretty weasely to always throw up the social anxiety ball instead of actually adressing the topic either with you, or actually adressing the condition with a therapist.¬†


She's also in a role where communication with strangers is pretty much necessary so I assume she can't be that bad socially.

I (45F) fired my mom (72F). 

Background:
‚Ä¢Financially incompetent: has nothing to speak of, no savings, owns no house or car, barely making it, has inherited $20k TWO different times in her life and blew it with nothing to show for it, was gifted a down payment for a house by her siblings - which she lost to foreclosure. She worked for herself cleaning houses, and now lives off of SS income. For entertainment she goes to the nearby casino. My brother recently loaned/gave her $500 to help her out - and she took $200 of it to the casino. She and her husband spend over $800 per month on cigarettes. 

‚Ä¢Relationship Background: for most of my adult life, we‚Äôd speak on the phone about once every four months or so. We didn‚Äôt visit each other (she lives 6 hours away). She never called or visited my kids (twins, 11/F). We basically lived our own separate lives. 

A year ago, she was struggling financially because her husband quit his job. I wanted to help, so I hired her to watch my kids. I‚Äôd fly her here once a month and she‚Äôd stay with us for a week earning a VERY good wage. This arrangement lasted a year until I let her go. She saved not a dime from all of this time. She went to the casino every time she‚Äôd get back home. I let her go because she was generally ungrateful, clearly hated being here (mopey) and struggled to bond with my girls - she‚Äôd just sit and play on her iPad. She wasn‚Äôt comfortable driving them, so she wouldn‚Äôt do school drop offs or pickups. I was home with them and participating in the childcare I was paying her to do about 80% of the time. She did laundry and house cleaning stuff mostly, not childcare. 

She has no life insurance, nor does her husband who is now pretty sick and probably not going to live much longer. She won‚Äôt be able to afford her rent after he dies without his SS payments, knows this, and does not attempt to plan for her upcoming homelessness. I think she expects for someone (me or her sister) to bail her out. She has been bailed out all of her life, and yet is always still struggling. I have expensive lifelong care to plan for for my daughter with severe autism. I cannot take in another dependent. She WILL be unable to afford her own life and housing very soon. WIBTA for putting this in the not-my-problem category?

I (31F) am living with my mother (62), father (60) and older brother (44) in the same house. Yeh the housing crisis is awful in my country lol.

First I will give you a summary of our family dynamics: Brother's father died when he was 5-6, mom married my dad when my brother was 9 and had me when my brother was 13. Dad is a retired army officer. They started butting heads when he was a teenager and when he got in trouble he sent him away (back to our home country from where dad was stationed so my brother wouldn't get in trouble with the law). He started living with us again when he was 24, didn't go to college and had a hard time keeping jobs. For a while he lived and worked in a different city but lost his job, and almost lost his life to drugs. Mom took him back without telling dad about my brother's drug problems. He didn't really work for 5 years even though dad and him were working together at my dad's small company. He did some work for him but was always complaining.

Here is the current problem: brother and mom want to sell the house my brother had inherited from his grandfather and then put it in a bank for interest so he can buy a better house. Dad wants him gone because now my brother has enough money to finally live on his own and as per my dad's words ""you cannot have property and multiply it under my roof while I am the one taking care of you at the age of 44."" This sentence caused a huge argument yesterday. Brother has been working at the same place for over a year now but his wage is not enough to move out. Mom and brother think that my dad wants the money for family's debt but I know that he just wants him gone and be on his own, taking care of himself, you know an actual adult. My mom doesn't want to let him out of her sight because she's scared that he would go down that drug rabbit hole and endanger his life once again.

So finally dad gave an ultimatum: Either my brother moves out and starts taking care of himself or my dad leaves and gets a place of his own and basically checks out from the family.

Dad says I am welcome to live with him when he leaves. But I just got a raise and finally I am in a financially good place to get my own place and be my own person. 

I feel like everybody needs me but I don't even know what to do. I just want to leave without saying anything even if none of them ever talks to me again.

So WIBTA if I leave my family and start my own life while my family crumbles down?

P.S. I've been going to therapy for years, I know this is not my problem to solve. All of them, including me, are grown ass adults. But growing up on a dysfunctional family fucks you up in more ways than one can imagine I guess...

Also I am a lawyer, even if my country's economy is down the drain, I'll somehow manage to live.

English is not my first language and I'm writing this on my phone so please accept my apologies.

If the housing crisis is dreadful where you live then it doesn‚Äôt actually matter how much money your brother gets for his grandfather‚Äôs house because the money will never earn enough interest to buy a property in the future. Housing prices will always rise a great deal faster than any interest you could earn on savings.

The other thing is that she has absolutely no sense if she honestly believes that her son is going to leave that money in the bank to buy a future home. He isn‚Äôt. He is going to spend it. While pretending he has no money to pay for his own place.

Your dad can leave but if he owns the house then he really should just evict your brother. If he doesn‚Äôt he should walk away.",2,1736301194.0,1hw332y

She‚Äôs making life more stressful for herself by not treating your brother like an adult and not seeing a therapist or group for parents of addicts.

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I called a girl out for pretending to be a fan of an artist in front of my class after she mocked me first for being a fake fan. She is now spreading this around the school saying I humiliated her and was mean. I think I was just defending myself, but several people have already sent me messages saying I should apologize so I don't k ow what to think.

This is the ONLY reason why you are not getting ESH from me. You were explicitly asked to explain. If you had not been explicitly asked to explain, you would have gotten ESH, because it was in front of the entire class.

m5wb8eo,Sudden_File4569,"ESH - I get the urge to want to be right, especially when someone corrects you. But there's a way to do it gently and gracefully. No need for either of you to call each other a 'fake fan'. I'm sure she loves rap every bit as much as you do, even if she doesn't know every detail of a rap beef from before you were probably born.

It sucks to be told you're wrong in front of a lot of people. I can understand why both escalated this situation. And I can understand why she's hurt because it's really painful to find out you actually are wrong in front of a big crowd. Neither of you handled this maturely. But both of your reactions to each others' immature actions make sense.

Music, movies, fashion, literature, and art all exist to help us build community. Shared interests are a way to find yourself and find your people. But when you meet your people and push them away because they got one small thing wrong you're undermining one of the purposes of art.

When we push someone away and call them a fake fan we are 'gatekeeping'. Gatekeepers try to stop anyone who doesn't know the same things they know from becoming a part of a community. You're both trying to do that to each other. And when there are two people who like hip hop at your school, you're making sure community won't happen. Instead of having a friend you can talk about hiphop with and share knowledge with, you both have a rival. And that sucks for both of you.

I'd encourage you to try to mend the broken bridge. Apologize to her for calling her a 'fake fan' and tell her that you didn't appreciate her saying that either. Tell her what hip hop means to you and that you understand it means a lot to her too. From there, the ball is in her court.",161,1736268879.0,1hvv9l3

I've been in situations like this (not about rap, but other things) when I know a subject very well and someone tries to show off by telling me I'm wrong, but I prove I'm right. Sure enough, they're butt-hurt & try to get others to think I'm the jerk. What I would do to defuse the situation (cuz you know they won't take the first step) is say something like, ""Hey (name), the other day, it wasn't cool of me to say you're a fake fan, cuz I know you're into rap like I am,"" and go from there, like, ""Eminem's one of my favorites.

Hello Reddit friends. My first time posting and need a little help. 
AITA for not giving my mom money after she told me that my siblings are more important than me? I (28) F has 4 kids 6,4,2 and 1 my mom (53 F) has 5 kids in total (34,33,30,28,23) her and I don't get along well due to me being ""the mistaken child"" I asked her a few times to help me babysit my kids so I can go to work or school. She told tell me no because now that I'm a mom ""moms stays home and dad works"" or she would say yeah bjt to give her $2000 for all 4 of my kids while the rest of her grandkids are free of charged. I told her I shouldn't have to pay her while everyone else is not paying her. She said because I'm the mistaken one if I wanted help from her I would have to pay her for daycare I have to pay her for food I have to pay her $1000 every MONTH for her to take care of me even though she didn't wanted me. I got my own place, i work at small businesses where I get paid $17.50 an hour. I don't have much money for her and my kids dad is currently incarcerated. She wanted to see my kids one time and she told me in order for her to see my kids I need to pay her $300 for her to drive to my house because my house is ""too far"" (guys I live 4 blocks away from her) I told her no and she got mad. She ended up babysitting my nieces and nephew for free I ended up having to get a daycare for my kids just so I can go to school or work. My mom randomly called me asking if I can give her $6000 when taxes comed because she pretty much helped me my whole life and I should at least give her some money. I told her no as I'm already struggling financially I also told her I'm not getting $6000 and I'm not even sure how much I'm getting she ended up calling me a worthless person who has no heart for helping her mother. I told her if she wanted to get money badly then get a dam job I'm not an atm I also told her I'm not responsible for her and I'm only responsible for my kids and I. She called me a bitch and sayong I'm the asshole for not giving me money. I know I'm not the ah but Reddit am I the ah?

I (27M) and my wife (27F) lived by ourselves in our apartment. One day I got a message from my friend (29M) looking for a place to stay after he had left the military. He had a new job delivering mail in town. We agreed to let him stay with us until he got on his feet. This included getting a larger apartment so that he could have his own privacy. In return, we asked him to pay $400 (for reference our rent alone is $2100) and to not have random men/women in and out of the house. Everything was fine for a couple of weeks. Everyone got along, everything was running smoothly. One night I am on the couch when a random lady walked into my home and I was asked by my friend to go to my room so that he can have some privacy. I told him, that if he wanted privacy he could go back to his room. I shrugged it off. I thought it was just one bad night.

 Boy was I wrong. The next four nights he had someone different coming in and out of the house. Just random people that he met on Bumble, or Tinder, etc. I tried talking to him about it and referencing that I needed him to have respect for me and our home. He proclaimed that since he paid rent he could do whatever and whenever and that I was just being controlling and manipulative. I thought that maybe I was doing too much, however, I told him I needed him to communicate when he is going to have people over because if I'm not home and my wife is at home sleeping after work (she's a night shift nurse) I need to ensure that she is safe. He then ignores my request and has someone over the next day while my wife is sleeping in the house. I'm upset and frustrated because this is my friend, and I feel disrespected. I want my wife to be comfortable in her own home as well, especially when she is doing MY friend a favor. I just need him to respect what I am asking, but I feel like I'm coming off as a douchebag.

Because if they are this bold and disrespectful now, imagine how they'll behave when the rails are off and they have nothing to lose because you have given them an eviction notice.


If they also signed the lease with your landlord and their income was counted as part of qualifying for the lease, you will first have to talk with your landlord needing to remove the roommate, and get their name off of the lease. If your income is sufficient to cover the lease, it probably won't be a problem.¬† If the landlord needs the higher income to keep you qualified for the rent, they may require you get another (approved) roommate, or paying additional security deposit.¬†

m5rs8hr,AriasK,"NTA for a number of reasons. The vibe is no kids. That means all the other women are excited about hanging out without any kids or babies around. She will ruin that for them. It will be unfair if she can bring her baby when no one else was allowed to. If it's an adult only party then I'm assuming there will be adult only behaviour, like excessive drinking. It's irresponsible and downright bad parenting to bring a baby into that environment. Lastly, if she can't spend one day away from her baby, then she has to miss out on this one event. Tough shit. That's life. We all make choices and sometimes that means we don't get to have our cake and eat it too. When you have a young child, there's lots of things you have to miss out on. That's a choice a person makes when they decide to have kids. I'm sure you, or your guests, have missed out on things due to being a parent. We all have.

Have you ever heard anyone use the term ""people-pleaser"" positively? That's because it sounds like a good thing, but it's really a justification for questionable behaviour that doesn't benefit the person who's doing it.

It's wildly unreasonable to want to bring a newborn to a birthday party. The baby being the focus of the party is likely a feature to her, not a bug.

If this friend doesn‚Äôt have a habit pre-baby of centering herself, I‚Äôd say she is finding motherhood different than expected. Those hormones are messy too. If it is her first, she is navigating this for the first time. We all make decisions differently in this early days. She may be going through a sense of lost identity. She could also be afraid to be alone with the baby, as you mentioned it‚Äôll be her first day without backup at home. Generally, make her feel supported, schedule a time to hang with her (and baby) only, and express concern over safety (flu season), noise, and logistics for her to come to the party. Empathize with her FOMO, but hold firm on your rule. Maybe thank her for making you feel so loved that she‚Äôd venture out with her new baby even when you both know she deserves rest & peace. Reassure her there will be other parties. Then ask about how she is doing. Really doing.

m5syo0w,Aggressive_Cattle320,"NTA  I'm sorry you had such a difficult time.  The clinicians are supposed to be understanding that people have all sorts of issues and situations they may be dealing with.  I feel for you, as I do have a hearing problem, severe anxiety, and a directional (left right) dyslexia.  I find it helpful to tell them of my problems, right upfront.  That way, they know I need their tolerance and understanding.  It IS confusing to know what they want us to do (step right, left, right arm up, turn feet, turn hips, do a handstand, look up, cross eyes, and HOLD YOUR BREATH!!).  I try to relax and tell them to just gently move me where they need me to be.  Thank God it's only once a year.

Next time, I'd ask to speak to a supervisor or head person on duty, if you run in to these problems.  It is their responsibility to provide patient care and they often drop the ball.

You were polite to an impolite person. It‚Äôs not your fault they were having a bad day. You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs in a vulnerable position at the imaging center.

I'm not understanding. You should get checked for it before you do a hearing test again. My partner kept saying my hearing was terrible, and I never heard him or heard him correctly and was constantly saying huh? What? Repeat that. So finally I went to a hearing doctor and not only is my hearing good but I could still hear some of the tones you're supposed to lose as an adult. Then I learned about auditory processing and was like oooooohh yeah okay that makes a lot more sense.¬†

m5t4389,mack_ani,"Struggling to hear speech isn‚Äôt always an issue of not being able to actually hear the words clearly-there are also auditory *processing* issues. This is when you can hear the volume of the speech just fine, but it can sound garbled or incomprehensible at times because of difficulty separating it from background noise and such. 

It‚Äôs fairly common, especially with conditions like ADHD, autism, etc. I use subtitles all the time because even though my hearing is super sensitive, I sometimes have trouble distinguishing the actual words (also because audio mixing in movies and shows is terrible now!! lol)

As an aside, it's possible you have an auditory processing disorder if this is a common issue for you and something your kids have pointed out. Your hearing can be perfect but if it's a common experience to not be able to make out what people are saying if there's a lot of background noise, or they're speaking quickly or not facing you when they talk, that could be an additional factor. 

That said, I have auditory processing issues and it's not something I just bring up as a warning to everyone I interact with, mostly just people close enough to have to put up with me saying ""I'm so sorry but can you please repeat that one more time"" after they've already said it three times.

Please tell the audiologist that your family is report hearing loss of voices, give as many details about the environments they notice it most in, ie we notice it in Applebee's, but not in Carrabas = conversation in chaotic noise vs conversation in quieter music, softer nearby voices. An ENT visit is warranted if this has come on suddenly or if it worsens with seasons/sicknesses, or improves if you can ""pop"" your ears.

 I was free on Christmas and asked both parents (they split up when i was born) if i could come. My abusive mother uninvited me and my brother interfered with my message in my fathers families group chat so you wouldn't immediately see it. I didn't send another because i thought my father could have easily scrolled up like three messages. Due to going through every stage of grief because of my mother uninviting me, i asked a friend if i could spend the 24th with them/their family, which they agreed on. My father asked me the Thursday before Christmas if i wanted to come. 

My father said he saw the message only later due to my brothers interference (like, after Christmas but nobody else had sent sth into the chat) and was thinking that i might have other plans as i am an adult and that he thought i knew i was welcome there. He also said he felt like me being there was only a plan B to me as my message was very brief and i didn't ask first how everyone is after last having been there/having had communication in October. However, my messages are always like this, i ask when I'm there in person. 

Context: He never reached out to me when i was living with my abusive mother and as i found out later, my visits were at some point only planned by his wife as ""he couldn't bear having contact with my mother"". When i was there, we didn't really have a relationship either as he wouldn't really talk to me. I finally got away from my mother and told him what it was like. First i felt relieved, but i quickly noticed that he wasn't there emotionally but more so gossiped about her too. Anyways, i do still visit sometimes. I told him about a pretty big achievement only to be met with a ""huh, anyways"". He helped me move again after being asked to and demanded i should appreciate his efforts because it's not something given for a parent to help their children move. I do also have contact to an ex friend of both who used to babysit me when i was a toddler who shared that my father was exactly the gold-digging racoon my mother described him as, proven by interactions she was part of, and that my mother apparently did want to arrange more contact but that he just refused to participate in those conversations. 

I think he could have asked earlier if i wanted to come for Christmas. Him messaging me so late was a sign he only though of me last minute and didn't really personally care if i am there. 

But i might be in the wrong. I have low self-worth, thus i often feel like i need proof that i am even allowed to exist in a place, but other people live less complicated. I understand that as a parent, you want to give your child freedom and want to make family gatherings much more optional. I also get how he thinks i have no interest in him given that we hold little contact (though it feels like he demands what he didn't give me in the first place).  

So, aita?

NTA That's a really scary situation and it's understandable you wouldn't have been your best self. You are only 17 and the ability to go through something awful without some inappropriate emotional reaction develops later. 

Are you sure the principal was talking about you? I can't imagine a senior leader being stupid enough to laugh about someone in their earshot while they are visibly having medical emergency. 

If you are sure she was talking about you then I'd ask your parents to complain to the school governors (or whatever your equivalent is). As adults we are not allowed to have inappropriate emotional reactions at work, especially not when working with young people. I'd talk to students who were witnesses to see if they are willing to give statements. 

BTW I only say that the name you called her was inappropriate as schools (certainly in the UK) put an emphasis on young people blindly respecting authority. I tell my kids to pay lip service and tell me what idiots teachers are but not to do it their face.

Today at school, I 17f had a severe allergic reaction. The cause is still unknown but I my body was fully broken out in hives and my throat was closing up along with a swollen tongue. I was sent to the office where my vice principal 30ishM, was trying to comfort me, because i was starting to panic. He called out for an EpiPen and I heard my principal 40ishF in the distance laughing about it to another teacher saying ‚Äúthis is so funny why‚Äôs she being so dramatic‚Äù. Once an ambulance came and I was given an EpiPen shot, I called her a hypocritical bitch on my way out to the er. She constantly goes around the school preaching safety and kindness but laughed when I was having a serious medical issue? Now, she‚Äôs upset and trying to get me in trouble but the vice principal told me not to worry and just tell my side. This was my first time having an allergic reaction ever so I was very confused and panicky.

When he stops barking for a few minutes I take him out. Whenever he over-barks I use this method. Also, in cases we are gone for more than an hour, I put him in a side room with his bed, water, toys, and food and he has become used to this as his ""safe space"" when we are gone. We've never had any neighbor complaints and we have often walked down the hallway and waited to see if we could hear him barking. Nope!

It seems like your neighbor attempts \*zero\* methods to control incessant barking. That is truly a shame. They could try training methods, a thunder vest , sound proofing a room, etc. I'm pretty certain any barking for more than 20 minutes straight can be reported to the building HOA as a noise complaint.

My neighbour has a small dog that barks incessantly when she or her husband leave the house to go shopping or do errands. This can be anywhere from 20 mins to an hour. I texted her and said ""is there any way you can get her to stop barking when you're out? She yaps for ages"". She responded ""It's only for a short time, what do you want me to do?"" I said ""maybe you could investigate some training methods? Id really appreciate it as it's quite distressing "". She replied ""no"".

I then ran into her husband outside and asked him if he could get the dog to stop barking whilst they are out. He agreed with me that her bark could be annoying and said he'd see what he could do. I said thankyou and went inside.

A short while later I was leaving the house and ran into her outside and asked if she was mad at me. She said she was. I said I didn't think my request was unreasonable. She said ""the place is a fucking monastery, she's a dog, you can't manipulate me like (insert name of other neighbour), you're lucky I work from home and not in an office eight hours a day"". I didn't know what to say so I just walked away.

Two days later I'm walking out my front door and there are two small sloppy dog poops covered in flies, on the communal lawn. There is always dog poop on the lawn. I text the neighbour group chat as there are two dog owners in our building. I hardly ever complain about the poop, but I'm annoyed now. ""hi everyone, there are two dog poops covered in flies on the grass. Could you please remove them, thanks"".

Neighbour A responds :"" sure, I'll do that as soon as I get home"". Barky dog neighbour says: ""how do you know it's ours? I've seen your cat poop on the grass"".

I don't think it's my cat. She poops pretty regularly in her litter tray. But how can I be sure?

I respond ""I don't know. Let's leave it there then. No worries "". I'm getting afraid of the confrontation and I just want it to be over.

I'm now anxious about running into her and I can't stop thinking about these interactions.

AITA for asking her to stop her dog barking when she's out?

 -- ANYWAYYYS, ahh thanks for the notifying!!

Needless to say I- understandably so; thought it was correlating to this much larger issue with my phone & have been in constant contact with Google support, Cashapp, Android Customer Service, etc-- long story short...
Upon the 17th time explaining my situation and the billion random albeit super debilitating issues with my phone & account/inaccessibility to yet another CS rep (different one each time)- he told me that the only explanation that he actually has was that he doesn't have one and has no idea himself why this was happening to me and was just as stumped as i, myself.. AND I'm a web[3]/software engineer & dev so its been even more frustrating..
But the same man from India (as he explained later), also told me that he can assure me that he was recently trying to utilize the art sub-reddit and couldn't post either & we actually connected & had a 15 min additional, non-issue related, totally comforting conversation via our similar online presences & intrigues and come to find out he was also a NFT artist & had actually, outbid me on a Low Effort Punk a couple weeks ago.

Random issue entirely, random conversation, random coincidence, but it made me a little less hostile & angry at my phone and life in general that I'd be able to rest assured my issue/glitch with the sub-thread (Reddit in general really), was at the very least; not just my own frustration and experience and that it would handle itself eventually.

m5xf9ab,ArtModBot2_0,"Adding this note because this post is likely to become controversial.  

Love it or hate it, Art is difficult, and artists deserve respect for their efforts. BEFORE COMMENTING, we require you to [READ OUR RULES](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/wiki/index#wiki_8._be_respectful_and_stay_on_topic).  

Since most of you won't, here's the short version:

1. Top-level comments MUST, FIRST and FOREMOST, address THIS artwork.  For example: 
 - ""Is it visually or technically interesting/uninteresting?""  
 - ""Does it effectively/ineffectively convey its message?""  
 - ""What specifically do you like/dislike about it?""  
2. And so on.  Tell us *why*.  Include details.  Try to use full sentences, and words of more than one syllable.  
3. Short snarky comments and general rants on the subject matter, or this sub, or Reddit itself, are trolling and will get you banned.   
4. Same goes for things like hate speech, personal attacks, political grandstanding, crude humor, creepy *anything*, and whatever else violates Reddit's site-wide rules.  Ban, mute, done.
5. Lastly, DO NOT talk about prints or sales.  Don't offer; don't ask. Instead DM the artist.

If you can't follow these restrictions -- DO NOT COMMENT.  Vote and move on.  If you do anyway, and get banned, [oh well ...](https://i.ibb.co/dBjndWD/image.png).

m61o5zg,nisebblumberg,"Explanation:   
""O' lo' and behold! There be adventurers here ready to go on yet another tromp!"" said Abram, smiling and smoking his pipe and using magic he once knew to twiddle an orb around his fingers.  
  
""What be your desire, old gaffer?"" said the four young adventurers, who were unnatural born like the old gaffer Abram, a series of people that appeared in the land one day to be judged for 100 cert and no more. Abram had reached a ripe old cert of 87 and had completed his adventuring, having made his wealth in hoard among the lands, and smiles to the new and spry adventurers.  
  
""Aye, I'm far too old to continue my pilgrimages. For I have lost an old sword somewhere nearby,"" smiled Abram, now gently rocking along the song of bird and whistling hollow tree.  
  
He smiled at the adventurers, with the troubadour looking back with puzzled eyes, brows raised, expectant of something more grandiose.  
  
Adventurers in the land of Niseb come in all shapes and sizes. They come to the plane of Niseb to be judged in the world as an ""unnatural born."" Unnatural borns are those that are born into the land to be judged for a specific time. Should they die, they reappear in the last village they were in, which was unlike the natural-born, who are born through normal means, ultimately fear death. What will the old Abram take them on? What blade did he leave in adventurers long past and forgotten by most? Only time and the tromp of adventure will tell the tale.  
  
Niseb is the world in between. The world between worlds and exist between two planes of existence: the plane of winds, the sapphire; the plane of flames, the ruby; and the plane of lands, the plane of the Alexandrite, Niseb.

Some people were speaking about putting money into a HYSA, however I do not have much experience with stuff like this, I barely have experience with life in general.

What are your guys' thoughts on using a HYSA, particularly the CIT High Yield Account that has 4.5% for a minimum of 5k deposit.

Are there any potential traps/catches I should be aware of? I don't want this money to be trapped as I might need it to cover costs of living in the future, so I want a safe but easily moved option that will allow me to use it when I need it.

If you need any more information please let me know, I will try to fill in any gaps to the best of my ability.

However, from what I can tell it only has a 0.15% APY, which seems rather low to me, and it only goes up to 0.50% APY once he has a minimum balance of $10,000 (he currently has about $3,600 in the account and it will be a while before he's able to reach 10k) and even then that seems pretty low. Does anyone have suggestions have suggestions on a HYSA or MMA with really good APY? Specifically one that will maintain its APY for a while, I saw a MMA that had a 4.5% APY but only for the first 3 months. Also open to other suggestions on what he could invest in.

Additional information/requirements:

* He's willing to deposit a maximum starting amount of about 5k, possibly a little more if necessary.
* Something relatively low-risk and low-maintenance that he can sorta just sit and let accumulate.
* Should be pretty liquid, would prefer to be able to put in and take out money relatively easily.
* His current account has no fees, so preferably something with no fees or a high enough APY that they are negligible.
* Undecided on goal of the account. Probably for an emergency fund or something he can let compound over time (so maybe something that will be taxed less when taken out?)
* We are planning on moving to an apartment in the next year or two so we want to make sure we have some savings.
* We live in upstate New York, he makes 55k annually, and he is currently living with his parents so he has fewer expenses.

My question is about when it makes sense to buy a home. I‚Äôve been renting for years ($1500/mo) and want to become a homeowner. I ran into about $200k inheritance at 20 years old, and it has been parked ever since. I then graduated college and began working, I was making $100k+ but quit that job for less responsibility and a better work life balance. I will have no problem pulling a new job at $75k+ in my industry, and will not make any decisions until that is solidified. I want to get married and start a family relatively soon. I keep telling myself that if I pull from my brokerage to buy a house, I won‚Äôt be able to retire in the future - but after 10 years of that, I feel like the benefits of pulling some of that money to be able to have a home would just make the entire situation better, and ultimately make me happier. I realize I am in a fortunate situation, but don‚Äôt know how to get started.

Does it make any sense to completely purchase a home using brokerage funds? Or does it make more sense to purchase that starter home and just cover the down payment/PMI from the brokerage and pay the mortgage with my income as if I was still renting? Or is there something else I can do? There are some first time homebuyer programs I am eligible for as well.

**Credit Utilization**: The only possible ""Drawback"" is high Credit Utilization.

I have used my credit cards both for budgeting and for almost all transactions (basically everything but rent / utilities) for years.

1. Required Monthly Expenses (Household, Groceries, etc)
2. Entertainment Expenses (Restaurant, Movies, Toys, etc)
3. Transportation Expense (Gas, Maintenance, Repairs, Insurance, etc)
4. Emergency Card.

The problem with debit cards is if someone is able to get your debit card number and use them against your wishes, and you have to deal with the bank fraud department to get your money back.  This means if someone takes out all your money, then you have to wait till the fraud department is done with their investigation before you can get your money back.

If you use a credit card and someone uses your credit card number, again you have to contact the bank fraud department to get the charge taken off.

m5z7gon,toodlesandpoodles,"I am far more aggressive for my age than I am ""supposed to be"". There are two reasons for this. 

1. Longer retirements. Part of living longer is living linger in retirement. For someone who retires at 67 with a life expectancy of 87, that is 20 years that their last dollar can be growing after they have retired. There are almost no periods of U.S. history where bonds beat stocks over this long of a time.

2. A shift in fed policy toward propping up the stock market through loans to businesses, quantitative easing, low interest lending, etc. In both 2008-2009, and 2020, events that in the past would have led to stock market collapses with long recovery times had their impact reduced by choices the government made to prop up the stock market. As a result, downturns were less extreme and the recovery was quicker. This should result in a shift in investing strategy towards being heavy in equities closer to retirement, as the risk of an extended downturn and extended portfolio losses is less than in the past when people came up with the portfolio percentages based on years to retirement. 

My thinking is that as one gets within a decade of retirement, one should shift 10 years of expected retirement living expenses to lower risk investments such as bonds, but leave the rest in equities. If the stock market takes a downturn, sell bonds to pay living expenses. If the market is up high, sell stocks to fund the next year of retirement.",19,1736300350.0,1hw73up

Lets say you contribute $100k to a 401k and have a 35% tax bracket so basically saved $35k.
But over decades, this grows to $1 million. You will end up paying a lot more in total tax dollars as you withdraw the $1 million even if say your bracket is 20%. if this were a ROTH, all your gains are tax free.

Another huge advantage of a ROTH is if you leave it as an inheritance, it is stepped up and the recipients also pay no taxes. Unlike a 401k where they would get a massive tax bill. In fact, a new law just went in allowing the recipients 10 years to withdraw and not ow taxes. If left in an index fund, it would likely double again. All tax free.

You are correct but contributing to a Roth does not minimize your tax burden whatsoever. It's post tax money. Contributing to a traditional IRA does minimize tax burden, however.

Option 1 is live at home for free and attend one of the two schools in my city. We have a big public uni and a smaller one. Both good. I think we can afford to pay tuition to those schools in total.

Alternatively get scholarship to go anywhere they want, live off campus/work to achieve what they want, get some loans to accomodate room/board somewhere or not go to college.

m5zy1e5,AttemptsAreMade,"Do they work, or do you give them an allowance for chores? A good way to teach kids about money is to give them some, and make the expectations for it clear. Open a savings account & checking account for each of them at your bank (in their names, with you as the parent oversight). Tell them what expenses are their responsibility‚Äîfor me, my earliest personal financial responsibilities were vacation souvenirs and gifts for my friends. Do they plan to pursue higher education? Have them save most of their money (whatever the source‚Äîbabysitting, birthday gifts from relatives, etc.) for their future. 

Now is a good time to make casual money talks routine if you haven't already‚Äîfor example, taking them grocery shopping and noting how much you expect to spend each week, or what your budget is for some other activity (clothes shopping, a vacation, etc.). In a few years, you could review the household budget with them. There might be expenses they haven't thought of that they'll need to consider when it's time for them to move out on their own. 

I would say general savings/higher ed budgeting and household budgeting come first. I personally wouldn't stress them out too much with retirement details until their late teens/early 20s, when they're starting to think beyond paying for the next semester (again, if they pursue some kind of higher ed). One thing that was really useful for me was having older siblings & cousins, so I naturally heard some discussions about IRAs and mortgages before it mattered to me.

m5y26mw,oceanicplatform,"Three rules for long term investing:

Think long term

Over decades you have enough time to buy stocks and ride out any ups and downs. There will be crashes and highs, but over a long enough timeline they average out.

Avoid fees 

Annual fees and trading fees cut your overall returns massively. Keep fees as low as possible by buying a low or no fee fund once and holding until ready to hand across to your child, say at age 23.

Don't try to beat the market 

Almost no fund manager beats the market more than a few years in a row. So instead, buy the market, via a cheap index fund like Fidelity or Vanguard or perhaps  Berkshire Hathaway B shares, to avoid any idiosyncratic risk with single stocks. It will go up and down but long term, over 15-20 years you will see gains of 10% p.a. and possibly more with BRK.B.

How to calculate returns 

You can calculate gains with this formula:

Starting capital x (1+annual return rate)^number of years

So 30k in a basic index fund for 20 years is

$30,000 x (1.1)^20 = $201,825

Inflation

This does not adjust for inflation but you can do that by subtracting 2-3% from the annual stock market return, so 7-8% instead of 10%.",1,1736287065.0,1hw2p6o

529 taxed for contriubtion, not taxed with growth as long as used a a qualified expense such as tuition, rent, scholarship. Then able to transfer up to $35,000 lifetime to a Roth IRA tax free, but still limited to $7000 a year into Roth IRA, so you oculd miss thouse years of contribution. If you take money out early for non qualified distributions you pay income tax plus a 10% penalty. If you wait to age 65, then there is no 10% penalty, but still must must income tax on the funds.

Roth IRA.

You have to get them income that is reasonable for their age, so you need to start a business, such as a tik tok superstar or clean the office, tidy up, shred documents for the business. $7000 limit a year and they will not have to skip the years of transfers to Roth IRA.

m624kc0,Responsible_Pen_8976,"I agree with some of the comments. 

From experience, buying a house at 19 is not a bad idea. Like any investment time is your friend and enemy. Start as early as possible. 

That said, you should look at your economic situation. Do you have enough for a down payment. Can you cover your fuel cost between work and home, 45 mins outside of Austin? You don't have school loans on top of you so that is a bonus. 

Yes, things can come up like issues with the HVAC or some emergency where you need money quickly. There is risk in every investment. The greatest and most absolute risk is not investing. Although you should keep the emergency situations in mind, don't let it paralyze you. Calculate your monthly expenses, plus the rent/mortgage and make sure you have enough to save at least 200 a month. In 10 months that will be 2000. That is a nice little cushion for anything unexpected. Then keep saving to keep building. 

If you buy a house, don't plan to sell for the next 5 to 7 years. Remember, the most valuable part of a home is usually the location because you can change anything about a home, except the location. (Unless it is a mobile home).

I think 10k save is too little. I think, you should get to 20k so that you can put a little more down. 

You will want 20% if you want to avoid paying a monthly fee known as PMI(Private mortgage insurance). It's a scam that allows lenders to charge PMI to finance a person that did not put at least 20% down payment. Unfortunately that is there. 100k house will be 20k as 20%. I would at least try to put down 10k, so you pay less PMI. Use the other 10k to cover closing fees and moving costs. You will need to put down a deposit for the electricity, natural gas, water ..etc. 

Not knowing a lot about your financial situation, 5k a month is 60k a year. How long would it take you to save another 10k? 

A couple can probably live on 25k a year, maybe less. But it takes commitment and willingness to sacrifice weekends at the club to instead be home, saving money. You can also invest some money to help build up the funds.",1,1736349064.0,1hwk77x

Sounds like a managed wealth account, assessing a 1.5% fee, but the real question is what the guaranteed minimum is.¬†

If you park $100k into a brokerage, invested 90% into VTI and 10% into a tax exempt muni bond fund, and then just rebalanced it every year (sell high, buy low) to ensure the 90/10 ratio, you can reasonably expect to have 10% growth on average. That means $100k becomes $1.74m in 30 years.¬†

You‚Äôre paying 1.5% every year to let someone else do this, shrinking your average growth to 8.5%, leaving you with $1.15m instead. If you pull out 10% a year for 10 years that‚Äôs the difference between $115k a year and $174k.

Myself I wouldn‚Äôt do it. My strategy is DIY, pick a broad diverse fund like VT and in my state a tax exempt muni bond like SWCAX.¬†

Then rebalance once a year. Once you hit 40 you can increase your bond allocation 1% each year, so 89/11, then 88/12, etc to protect your account from market crashes. By 50 it‚Äôs 80/20, by 60 it‚Äôs 70/30, etc.¬†

Edit: was reminded this is an IRA, so just buy BND an aggregate bond index.¬†

Target date funds essentially do this too:

Buying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary & uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money.

If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.

I prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well. The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above. Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares & ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.

The funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors. Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically. Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.

Other companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades & because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.

m5vyda1,Ok_Visual_2571,"Lawyer here (not your lawyer).  

Fire your advisor.  Full Stop.

An annuity is a complicated hybrid of investment and insurance.  Generally an annuity will have serious penalties if you want out of it.. both tax wise and fee wise.  With an IRA you can transfer it from Fidelity to Vanguard or vice versa or change the funds of stocks in the IRA with no penalty or cost.

Most annuities are laden with sales commissions and they are sticky, i.e., hard to get out of.  Will your advisor pick the funds in your annuity account and then get 1% of assets under management for the annuity account and then get $1,000 a year for doing very little on top of the initial sales charge.

There are reasons to own annuity and after you have a few million of net worth, have maxed out all of the easier tax avoidance vehicles (529, IRA, ROTH, etc), you might consider an annuity and if you do so, the best place to do so is on your own at Fidelity, but I see no advantage of for converting your IRA into an annuity only commissions for your ""advisor"" fees, loss of choice as to what investments to hold, and lack of flexibility as where your assets are held.

Finally, an annuity like any insurance product is only as good as the carrier behind it.  If the insurance carrier writing the annuity fails you could sustain losses.  You will sleep better having your money at a to big to fail financial services company (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab) than the annuity company that offered your advisor the largest kickback.

Do not buy any financial products that you do not understand. 

Let me suggest that you open an account at Fidelity and transfer those assets currently with your advisor to the Fidelity Account.  Then you can have the same exact assets, only with a 1% of assets under management (AUM) headwind.  Your 17% return fell short of the 2024 S&P return of 23%.. so perhaps your returns would improve replaced some of your current asset mix with a S&P 500 ETF.",8,1736265055.0,1hvt3rx
m5weiu8,daytodaze,"I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for this, but here it goes: SCS, or Structured Capital Strategies, is a type of variable annuity.  It can track the S&P 500 (or other indexes) and also has a buffer that will absorb losses if the market turns negative during your contract term.  Does this advisor work for equitable (they issue the product).  As far as annuities go, this is actually a decent product.  Most annuities are high fee and have some living benefits that will pay you income, but the returns are pretty terrible (because of proprietary investments and fees), whereas this product is pretty simple and is designed for growth.  Cons: liquidity (you have to leave your money in for 6 years), no dividends (your actual performance will lag the S&P 500 by about 1.5% because you don‚Äôt actually own the index, but rather a bunch of options that more or less mirror the market), and performance caps (if the market does abnormally well, you may miss out on some of the returns).  Pros: no fees in this account, it uses indexes that are not proprietary (S&P 500, for example), your principal is protected by the buffers.

These recommendations are not an immediate red flag, but ask more questions and make sure your advisor is explaining why he/she thinks this is a good idea for you.  SCS and MWP (which is a managed account solution Model Wealth Portfolio) mean nothing in isolation and are just acronyms.  It‚Äôs up to the advisor to explain why they fit in this situation and up to you and your spouse to decide if this will actually benefit you.",4,1736269846.0,1hvt3rx
m5vxl6k,Cakehenn,I'd rarely suggest putting retirement funds into an annuity is a good idea (never say never).  One of the biggest benefits of an annuity is that it grows tax-deferred.  This benefit becomes redundant in an IRA since its already growing tax-deferred.   There are some safety net features that are pretty nice but you pay a premium for those.  If you had after tax money and you're getting killed by the income and capital games those funds would be more suitable for an annuity.,2,1736264821.0,1hvt3rx

I‚Äôm guessing your advisor is affiliated with LPL Financial, which is the largest brokerage / investment advisory firm in the country (they have over 20k advisors). I say this because you mentioned MWP and that‚Äôs a popular investment advisory product (Model Wealth Portfolios) they offer for clients with account balances as low as $10k. The name and logo on his office / website / letterhead may display a different business name but if you look at the disclosures at the bottom of his website, etc., where it starts with ‚ÄúSecurities and advisory services offered by‚Ä¶‚Äù, I‚Äôm guessing it will say LPL Financial.

In short, the product charges an ongoing advisory fee that could be anywhere from 0.5% - 2% annually, depending on your advisor. It should be clearly stated on the paperwork. For that fee, they will recommend several underlying ETFs and/or mutual funds, and access to investment advice from the advisor. If this is valuable to you, then it may be a good fit. If not, then you can easily open an account elsewhere like others here have pointed out and DIY to avoid the ongoing advisory fee.

m5z0qs5,rnelsonee,">Most resources I've seen say to first max out the $23,500 limit and then use the MBDR, but I'm unclear on why. 

Remember Roth 401k's are pretty new (2006, versus the 1970's) - *the* 401k limit being referred to by these articles (or, say, comments here) are generally referring to the pre-tax limit. It's hard to create a scenario in which someone who can afford to contribute over $30,000 to retirement ($23.5k + $7k backdoor) would ever possibly *choose* to do Roth unless they've already maxed out their pretax options. Roths are for low-income people - willingly paying income tax during the years you earn a large salary is not normal.

So the short answer is: you do MBDR after the normal 401k because with MBDR you're forced to pay tax now.

>From an early retirement perspective, seems more advantageous to solely use the MBDR

Simply no - there is no better way to *guarantee* you will waste tax money by doing only MBDR. Where's your taxable income in retirement coming from!? Remember 72t/SEPP exist. Roth ladders exist. The Age of 55 rule exists. These exist because you'd rather pay taxes in retirement versus the hay-making years when your income was so high you could save $30k+ of it. You want income in retirement to fill up that $30k standard deduction, and that $20k 10% bracket, and the $75k 12% bracket. All those dollars will be taxed less than your MBDR contributions.",4,1736298100.0,1hw5l5n
m5z06dy,sciguyCO,"First potential difference that'd make option 1 better: if your employer offers a match, they may only do that against your ""employee deferral"" (regular $23k limit contribution for both pre-tax + Roth) but **not** any after-tax contribution (the first step of the MBDR).  You'd have to clarify the situation under your particular plan with the plan manager (usually in HR or benefits department).  

Second difference: when you leave this job, if you rollover out of this 401k into an IRA, Roth 401k contributions are essentially identical to regular Roth IRA contributions: that total amount counts towards your IRA's ""basis"" and can be withdrawn without penalty even before age 59.5.  I think with the MBDR your converted after-tax contributions have to wait until 5 years since the conversion (and this applies to each year's converted amount separately) to drop that penalty.  May or may not matter depending on your plans and how things ultimately work out around the size of your balance.

Having that ""contribution amount"" to tap during early retirement can be a useful strategy, but since you'd likely be leaving the company (allowing withdrawals of any type) isn't impacted by whether that amount was built up via regular Roth 401k contributions or through the MBDR.

Whether you can roll MBDR balance to an external Roth IRA while still employed depends on your plan.  In my experience, which I admit may not be universal, I've only seen that when the 401k plan itself does not offer a Roth option (not your situation).  In that setup, the Roth conversion results in the money flowing from paycheck => after-tax 401k contribution => that outside Roth IRA.  But if the converted money remains in the 401k plan, it will likely be under the same rules for an ""in service distribution"" (withdrawal while employed) as any other 401k balance type.",2,1736297913.0,1hw5l5n

The good news is that with that salary, and those expenses, you should be able to save quite a bit. Can you give a breakdown of where your money is being spent each month, and also let us know what your monthly take home is?",51,1736255526.0,1hvqyrx

m5v99wg,gullykid,"Depends entirely on your spending.  A simple rule is take your yearly expenses, multiply by 25, and that's how much you need saved/invested to most likely be able to stop working and preserve your principal balance.

There are other more elaborate tools like networthify.com where you can plug in numbers to estimate time frames.  With your 150k salary, annual expenses of $50k, starting from zero, you could possibly be there in 10 years. A lot of assumptions on market performance there, but still demonstrates you can retire significantly earlier than most folks if you control spending. r/financialindependence has a lot more info.",8,1736256386.0,1hvqyrx

m5v78ui,sol_beach,You are free to move to the woods tomorrow & nobody here prevents you from doing so.

m5vvkji,Evening-Egg3052,"Well, based on those numbers you‚Äôre likely doing a job nobody else wants to do - Oil rigs? ¬†Private security? ¬†Trauma nurse? ¬†Doesn‚Äôt really matter what it is - this will change your life if you can stick it out for a few years. ¬†I‚Äôve been there - focus on the end goal. ¬†

OK. ¬†First, look into whether you can do a mega backdoor ROTH. ¬†You‚Äôll need a CPA for this, but spending a little money on that person can save you $$$$ in taxes down the road. ¬†https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/mega-backdoor-roth. ¬†If you can‚Äôt, then max out a regular ROTH and 401K. ¬†Make sure that what you contribute is invested in the market. ¬†That probably seems obvious, but I know someone who opened a ROTH and let the $ sit in a money market. ¬†

The old mutual fund: ¬†it‚Äôs 30 years old and you‚Äôre 30, so I‚Äôm guessing some enterprising person gifted it to you when you were born ($1000 invested over 30 years at 10% is about $19,000). ¬†Whether you should move it depends a lot on taxes. ¬†Right now you‚Äôre likely in a high tax bracket. ¬†If you sell it now, then you‚Äôll pay on all the profit. So look at the underlying mutual fund. ¬†If it‚Äôs doing well then just let it ride until you hit a lower tax bracket. ¬†But if my assumption is wrong and it started much higher (for example if they gifted you $5k and 30 years later it‚Äôs only $19k), then you should move it.

$77k in the HYSA - only you know what you want for your farm, but if you can get it without a mortgage, I say go for it. ¬† Just make sure you also have some savings for all the repairs, taxes, etc that come with every home. ¬†

HSA: get the therapy.¬†

As for investing, until you research and decide on your investment approach, I recommend sticking with the basics like VOO or VWUSX. ¬†",5,1736264203.0,1hvqyrx
m5x7gdw,timerot,"If you're serious about living on $1000/mo in the woods, then you need about $1000 * 12 * 25 = $300k saved up in broad market, low fee index funds. Based on your income and spending, that should take less than 5 years.

This is somewhat of an insane plan given current American prices. The people at /r/leanfire have been living this life, and they consider double what you're planning to be lean.

If you're seriously considering this, then you should not buy a house. Houses make sense only if you're planning to be in a fixed location for 5-7 years. You can save up to subsist on a poverty-level retirement before that happens. Buying a house will give you a mortgage, which will extend the timeline until you can get to a lean early retirement, since your excess funds will go to paying a mortgage and maintaining a house instead of building a nest egg. It will also be harder to live in the woods when you have a multi-thousand dollar mortgage payment (plus property taxes and insurance) that needs paying every month.",3,1736278221.0,1hvqyrx

Actions I would take: 1) of your 77k, set aside an emergency fund of 8-10k to be used for nothing else than emergencies - I.e. 8 months of living expenses. Put it into a separate savings account.  2) invest at minimum 15% of your income into retirement vehicles - both your Roth 401k and an IRA. move your $19k into that Roth IRA as your starting base and add to it. Fidelity is a great place for beginning investor to have access to a lot of mutual fund options. Have your Roth IRA withdraw a set amount each month 3) once you‚Äôve done that, reassess your monthly budget to determine the excess money for any of the following: additional investing, saving to replace a car and pay in cash, saving for 20% down payment on your cabin the woods, saving for a vacation, etc. Make sure that rewarding yourself, within reason, is part of your equation.

The reality is that you'll never be happy if you think that way, you'll live in a perpetual state of burnout and holding on for that next happiness goal post.

m5v9t3h,FundingFulfillment,"There's a rule of thumb out there called The 4% Rule that is a great starting point for answering the question of ""how much do I need?"" 

If your monthly spend is $1000 (or less), the rule states that you need enough money invested in primarily stocks to withdraw $12,000 each year with a very low chance of ever running out. It turns out the withdraw percentage that accomplishes this is 4%. 

So, $12,000 is 4% of what number? Just take $12,000 times 25 to find out...$300,000. This applies to how you are living now. If you plan on changing your lifestyle you'll need to estimate your annual expenses and use that. 

Some will probably point out concerns with the idea of the 4% rule but I am offering it as a starting point. Whether you use 4% or 3.5% doesn't really matter if you're are just starting to learn about this topic and previously thought it will take $8M for example. (I don't think you believed this, I'm just trying to illustrate the idea that the 4% rule is a good ballpark starting point.)

""Today marks 5 years clean & sober from all drugs and alcohol. To say that I‚Äôm thankful would be a poor euphemism. Gratitude hardly scratches the surface.""

> She continued, ""It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm sober that I get to smile today. I get to make music. I get to experience the joy of loving my dogs and cat. I get to feel heartbreak in all (its) glory. I get to grieve. I get to laugh. I get to dance. I get to trust. I feel the sun on my skin and it‚Äôs warm. I‚Äôve found that life keeps happening regardless of whether I‚Äôm sober or not, but today I get to show up for it.""

So unless the Trump Bernie alliance of capping interest rates at 10% goes through (I'm very skeptical) you can expect more of these hospitals to try to push these third-party credit plans. 

Also keep in mind that revisions, I believe in Secure 2.0 or maybe in the infrastructure bill (Also Biden admin) already restricted medical debt from impacting your credit score so it might have been on your credit profile but it was supposed to be ignored.

Edit: now that I think about it when my wife was in the ER we got a simple credit application that was basically like break bill into payments no interest for 6 months, but it's run by a third party company so it looks like they were anticipating this and are already doing it because that takes that debt off of the hospital's books and if you default on it you obviously can't get another loan.

>‚ÄúThe dog's owners say Charlie went missing one week ago Monday after being let out on a foggy morning.

>The couple says they spent days trying to find him until they got help from one group using thermal technology.

>A thermal drone scanned a Crystal Lake neighborhood in search of the family's missing dog.

>Then suddenly, blue and green images turned clear.

>""Oh my God! Got him! Yes, we got him! We got him!"" one of the rescuers said.

>Video captured the moment 2-year-old Charlie was found Sunday near Huntley and Ackman roads, a mere two-minute walk from home.

>""And, he was in this, kind of, park, walking trail area off in some tall grass and broken-down trees. And, he was hiding there,"" said Kate Belmonte, Charlie's owner.

>Kate Belmonte and her fianc√©, David Nowak, had been looking for the Bernese Mountain Dog since last Monday morning.

>And with the help of Dog Gone Pet Recovery, a Lake Villa animal search and rescue group, they were finally reunited with their canine best friend.

>Though, he was badly hurt. Charlie was taken to a veterinary hospital with a broken femur.

>The couple is thankful for Charlie's will to survive in the cold for nearly a week and for the group's days-long effort to find him.

>""It's just unbelievable technology, and pretty much without this, to be honest with you, I don't know we would've been able to find him,"" said David Nowak, Charlie's owner.

>David and Kate said Charlie is still at the hospital, recovering after surgery Monday, but will be back home on Tuesday, warm and cozy with the couple and their other two dogs.‚Äù

I am simply being allowed to claim what I have already earned when i turn 67, just like other Americans who have paid into the system, in the event that I teach in a state without SS for teachers. But I'm not being granted a new benefit. I'm just being allowed to claim the benefit that I already earned.


It's true that this fix has a small effect on the solvency of the program, but they shouldn't have been screwing us over in the first place IMO. After all, we pay social security taxes in order to get any benefit just like anyone else. This bill only effects government employees who have paid into the system. It doesn't give anyone a free lunch. The teachers who didn't pay in because their state opted them out still won't be getting a check unless it is as a beneficiary for a spouse who paid in.


Put another way, in the old system as a career changer I would have been rewarded for working at a liquor store or casino with a larger SS check.

m61j7tt,addit397,"Hi, Indonesian here.
While the concept of the free lunch program is fantastic, the execution so far has been horrible.

Before I continue, know that the news I've gotten is from Indonesian news sources, not from direct experience.

The supposed budget for the school lunch program is apparently just 10 thousand rupiahs, which is just around 60 Cents in USD.

In the Indonesian subreddit, you can even see people sharing articles about how absolutely terrible the quality of food is. Cold rice, bland chicken, etc. You can also see a post about how you aren't allowed to take pictures of the food.

Plus a lot of people, including myself, believe that this program is just an empty promise made by the current president in order to help him get elected. Also have I mentioned the fact that our current president is a war criminal and gave a position to a ultra religious conservative who hates Chinese people (which I am) as part of his cabinet.

And going a little off topic here, a lot of us also believe that the reason people elected him is because there's a lot of fuckery regardy his VP who is our previous president's son, and how his father is attempting to create a political dynasty through messing with a lot of rules and making sure that his family gets elected to positions of power.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but even though it is uplifting on the surface, this is just smoke and mirrors to my knowledge.

m5stbi0,ControlCAD,"> Actress Demi Moore took home the Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy on Sunday night. The win was Moore's first-ever acting award in her storied career.

> Moore, 62, won the Globe for her starring role in The Substance. In her acceptance speech, she said she thought she was done with acting until The Substance script came along.

> Though the film has brought her a milestone award, Moore doesn't see it as a culmination of her career but rather as the start of a new chapter, she said when the film first came out in September.

> ""It's the beginning,"" Moore told NPR's Tonya Mosley on Fresh Air. ""I've never been where I am exactly in this moment. My children are grown. I have the most independence that I've ever had. And so it's just this wonderful new time of exploration and discovery ‚Ä¶ I just want to stay present to where I am and be open to the possibilities.""

> The Substance follows Moore's character, Elisabeth Sparkle, as she takes a mysterious drug meant to transform her into a better version of herself. Moore told Mosley that she brought her own lived experience to the role.

> ""I don't know if I was more perfect than someone else, but I definitely felt that I had a body of experience that really could be brought to it,"" Moore said.

> Her daughters, Scout, Tallulah and Rumer Willis, are also celebrating Moore's win. The trio shared a video on Instagram Sunday night reacting to their mother's win.

> ""This is a huge win for EVERYONE,"" Scout Willis commented on the post.

> On Sunday night, Moore said on the Golden Globes stage that she was once called a ""popcorn actress,"" a label which made her feel like she could not be acknowledged in the industry. She ended the speech by celebrating the win as a ""marker of [her] wholeness"" and the love that drives her.

> ""In those moments when we don't think we're smart enough or pretty enough, or skinny enough or successful enough, or basically just not enough,"" Moore said. ""I had a woman say to me, 'Just know, you will never be enough. But you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick.'""",39,1736213682.0,1hvfv4o

m5mbr02,Greaterdivinity,"Folks should read the article. A few excerpts -

>

A handful of local newspapers across the US have in recent years launched programs **to review their archives and consider requests to remove names or delete old stories to protect the privacy of subjects involved in minor crimes.**

And an example cited -

>He recalled an early case of a¬†[drunken teenager](https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2018/07/right_to_be_forgotten_clevelan.html)¬†who broke part of a monument in a cemetery and was charged. Years later, he had ‚Äúcompletely atoned‚Äù and was starting to apply for jobs, Quinn said. ‚ÄúHe did something stupid as a kid ‚Ä¶ and he said: ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt move on.‚Äô‚Äù The editor granted his request, removed his name and presented it to his colleagues as a model for similar cases.

Seems reasonable? We've all done dumb shit as teenagers, and as long as the individual served time and hasn't re-offended I see no reason for the article to remain online forever for any employer to easily find.

>There was some initial internal resistance, but eventually Quinn and his staff came up with general parameters: they would not erase names in cases of violence, sex offenses, crimes against children or corruption. Police officers would be treated as public officials, so stories of their wrongdoing would remain. The incident typically had to be at least four years old, although the paper has made exceptions. Quinn did not want to have strict rules, since every case is different. The guiding question, he said, was: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs more valuable ‚Äì this story remaining available to the public, or this person being able to move on?‚Äù

Again, seems reasonable!

This is local media being responsive to local community needs, something they've historically done. It's clear that there's no malicious intent here and that any new outlet participating is taking this seriously alongside their responsibility to their community/readers.

It's important to note: This kind of information was largely only ever really available via background checks, which employers should be doing on employees. It was never really accessible through the newspaper unless someone archived every issue of the local paper, nor were the local news stories easily accessible outside the community.

If you do something stupid - it shouldn‚Äôt just ‚Äúgo away‚Äù.  I get the whole second chance thing but to know what you‚Äôre dealing with even if years have gone by I think is important.

If we have things like Megan‚Äôs law out there for folks of one particular type of crime out there to let us know where and what they did, why are any other crimes any different?

If someone stole merchandise from a store 20 years ago - I wanna know if I hire them in a retail scenario because what if they get the temptation again should they see the opportunity.  No different than a predator being given the temptation if they are around kids‚Ä¶ regardless of they‚Äôve been thru therapy and it‚Äôs been 20 years.  The concern is there and the crime was committed regardless of what it was.

Folks can be forgiven, let out, rehabilitated, done their time, whatever.  But we all know that the temptation is going to be there.  alcoholics have sponsors because that temptation is there and they need folks to call upon when times become tough or difficult.  

There is a guy I know from my childhood.  Was recently brought up on charges that would put him in jail and be registered the rest of his life.  I sort of saw the downfall of him the last few years on social media - but deep down I know what sort of person he was.  So it wasn‚Äôt surprising.  What helped me confirm my suspicions was looking up his legal records - it was crazy but it only backed I up even more.  But sadly it was one of those things that you could watch the spiral slowly happen over the last 25 years between his legal issues and eventually his last arrest.  It was even in the paper/internet and to be honest - I would never want anyone in my family to work with this guy knowing what he is like‚Ä¶. So to now erase those public things that in reality happened is no different than erasing history because you don‚Äôt want it to exist anymore‚Ä¶ same thing history book writers have done for decades leaving things out or bending half truths.",3,1736171796.0,1hum65u

**Bush demanded billions for AIDS in Africa at his 2003 State of the Union. It paid off.**

'That's going to cost a lot of money'

In early 2002, Fauci presented Bush with a proposal to spend $500 million to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa through the targeted use of antiretrovirals, which both treat and prevent the transmission of the virus.

Bush was impressed, Fauci recalled. But before the NIAID director left the White House meeting, the president pulled him aside. **Bush told Fauci he wanted an international AIDS relief program that was much bigger.**

In an exchange that would dramatically change the course of human history, Fauci recalled saying to Bush, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to cost a lot of money, maybe billions of dollars.‚Äô‚Äù

**Bush told Fauci not to let cost hold him back.**¬†

**Fauci promptly got to work, spending the remainder of that year developing a proposal with a small team sworn to secrecy.**¬†",4178,1735962711.0,1ht4hey

>These clubs give inmates a sense of purpose, humility and redemption, all while teaching them skills to reintegrate into society when they're released.

>""Our club is mainly focused on teaching a new skill to our fellow inmates,"" said Antonio Cavasos, an inmate at the Penitentiary of New Mexico in Santa Fe.

These militia groups, like the [American Patriots Three Percent (aka AP3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Patriots_Three_Percent) and the [Oath Keepers,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_Keepers) are incredibly organized and deeply entrenched with plans to interfere with every democratic process, but especially elections. We aren't just talking about their political grievances or engaging in online rhetoric‚Äîthey are actively planning and training for real-world actions.

For instance, they were setting up surveillance operations around ballot boxes, under the guise of ""preventing fraud,"" but it was clear that their goal was to intimidate voters and sow fear. They also have ties with election denial groups, working together to spread misinformation and coordinate efforts to undermine trust in the electoral system. This isn‚Äôt just about disrupting one election‚Äîthey are gearing up for the long term, building infrastructure to mobilize quickly and act decisively should an opportunity arise.

And the level of preparation is alarming. They are training members in combat and tactical maneuvers, basically preparing for violent confrontation. They view themselves as soldiers in a broader cultural and political war. What‚Äôs really disturbing is how they are using these plans to recruit more members, playing into fears of government overreach and societal collapse.

It failed when the Democrat speaker of the House continued to commit insider trading with zero accountability, or when, in the light of the threat of fascism, rather than send one ofthe parties' few likable reps to the head of the ethics committee, she sent a geriatric old man with throat cancer on death's door.

Since 2016, anyone who knows and pays attention has been pointing to the obvious fact that a fungal rot like Donald Trump would never have the ability to grow in a just, stable, equitable society.

Power has caved to money for decades. This is the result. A population so sick, stupid, and deluded that a piss-poor coal miner in West Virgninia thinks a pants-shitting idiot billionaire trust-fund baby who shits in a golden toilet is going to represent his best interests in the White House. 

It failed when THIS FUCKING NEWS PAPER - the NYT - spent a FUCKING DECADE sanewashing Donald Trump and catering to their idiot ridiculous bilionaire owners rather than print the fucking truth. They spent the last year and a half continually demeaning and attacking Joe Biden for his age and helping ensure he'd lose the next election because the people who hold their leashes salivate at the return of a kleptocrat.

It's been a game of appeasement and avoidance for the rest of the population since then. We have steadily frittered away our human rights in order to keep conservatives from driving 330 million people into a chasm of flaming shit. 

The only progress made over that time has been made grudgingly through backdoor routes like budget reconciliation or the occasional court win. Those changes are fleeting, as SCOTUS has recently shown us. Much of the progress we thought we had made has been walked back, and what remains is on the chopping block.

1. That's a prosecutor doing his job. They're describing Jack Smith doing exactly what he was asked to do. He is *not* supposed to assist them with their defense.
2. If this had gone to trial, Trump's team would have gotten the chance to refute the charges, and the record would no longer be one-sided, and we could weigh the pro and con arguments. This is how our Justice system is meant to work.

How to Cross the Government‚Äôs ‚ÄòValley of Death‚Äô and Fix How It Spends Billions on Stuff
Jan. 8, 2025, NYT



      America has a recurring problem 


Truman was presented with 
documents of business ties between Nazi Germany and major American corporations and serving members of congress and  ultra-right violent groups spreading the same kind of propaganda, and planning violence, to overthrow of the U.S. government.

When the ( then AG) Attorney General brought it to the White House and shared it directly with President Harry Truman, He orders the report to be classified as secret and essentially buried, and never see the light of day because it was  too explosive. 

**And J6 is indeed very characteristic of America First Aka MAGA**

These insurgents have been trying to overthrow our Democracy for 80 years.


Both seasons should be required listening for all students and Americans: 

[Ultra audio- book by Rachel Maddow](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rachel-maddow-presents-ultra/id1647910854)

Well put, sir - and please continue to stand your ground against U.S. fascists like Trump, his son and their ilk. Despite the questionable latest U.S. election results the majority of Americans do NOT support MAGA Republican extremism/fascism.

As a treasonous Russian asset, Trump has consistently acted to further the interests of his longtime benefactor, Vladimir Putin. This dynamic is evident in his geopolitical focus, such as his interest in Greenland, Canada, and the Panama Canal:

* **Greenland**: Home to a critical NATO military base that helps protect Europe from foreign aggression, including threats to Ukraine and Poland‚Äîkey targets in Putin's expansionist agenda.

* **Panama Canal**: Currently enforces sanctions on Russian vessels, sanctions Putin is eager to see lifted.

* **Canada**: Holds vital territorial claims in Arctic oil and gas reserves and controls strategic maritime routes‚Äîrights Putin would prefer to dismantle.

So, who is Trump really working for? Certainly not the United States, as he undermines American allies and advances Putin‚Äôs ambitions at every turn.

m5yv153,DomesticErrorist22,"From the article: 

> Three senior U.S. Justice Department officials committed misconduct in the final months of Donald Trump‚Äôs first presidency by leaking details about a non-public investigation, a move that may have been intended to sway the 2020 election, the department's internal watchdog concluded in a new report.

> Reuters obtained the December report by Inspector General Michael Horowitz through a public records request. The report found the officials improperly shared details with two media outlets about the department's plans to collect data on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes located in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan, four states with Democratic governors who had come under fire for their handling of the pandemic.

> The leak ‚Äú**will be our last play on them before the election but it‚Äôs a big one**,‚Äù one of the officials wrote in a text obtained by investigators.

> The report did not identify the employees, though one of them worked in the Justice Department's public affairs office. They no longer work at the department, according to the inspector general's office.

> ""The conduct of these senior officials raised serious questions about the partisan political motivation for their actions in proximity to the 2020 election,"" Horowitz wrote.

> Federal prosecutors began looking at deaths in nursing homes in the middle of 2020, as the pandemic was cutting a deadly path through some facilities. The review focused on facilities in New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all of which had Democratic governors who had issued orders requiring the homes to accept COVID patients.

> The Inspector General concluded that Trump administration officials instructed attorneys to ‚Äú**focus specifically on New Jersey and New York despite having been provided data indicating that the nursing homes with the most significant quality of care issues were in other states.**‚Äù

> In October 2020, department officials sent letters to the governors of New York and New Jersey seeking more information about nursing home deaths. The inspector general said the officials provided the letters to the New York Post before they reached the governors, and that another official spoke anonymously to the newspaper. That, the report said, violated the department‚Äôs policies limiting contacts with the press.",93,1736296226.0,1hw6nat

Regardless of if this is all trolling or not, countries that thought they were protected by the US and its nuclear capabilities are seeing erratic threats being thrown around at allies, particularly those that are smaller and vulnerable. They're likely already on edge and looking at how he's avoided accountability in his domestic legal battles, I doubt there's much faith internationally that Trump would be held in check by the rest of the government. If this continues, they have two options - turn to another nuclear power, three of them being our adversaries, for security assurances or start to develop their own capabilities. 

This could incur a massive nuclear buildup - which is dangerous for reasons beyond the increased potential for a nuclear exchange. Countries scrambling to develop nuclear capabilities isn't exactly ideal for the safety of surrounding populations environmentally and uneven development could be extremely destabilizing, say, in the context of a regional dispute. These are actual nightmare scenarios that we could be moving closer to because Trump thinks he can bully Canada into saying they paid his tariffs.

No seats changed hands in the first special elections of 2025, with Democrats easily holding two Virginia legislative districts and Republicans holding a third.

The wins helped Democrats retain razor-thin majorities in Richmond and answered a post-election question: whether liberals were so depressed about their defeat that their Biden-era turnout operation would suffer.

Democrat Kannan Srinivasan took the state Senate seat of now-Rep. Suhas Subramanyam by 23 points, a slight improvement over Kamala Harris in the exurban DC district; Democrat JJ Singh won Srinivasan‚Äôs state delegate seat by the same margin. Republican Luther Cifers prevailed in the central Virginia seat vacated by now-Rep. John McGuire, but strong Democratic turnout shrunk the GOP advantage; Trump carried the seat by 29 points, and Cifers by 18.

‚ÄúWhile we celebrate tonight, our focus is already on November,‚Äù said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which helped defend the northern Virginia seats.

Car loans, credit card applications, home equity loans, your credit score to rent an apartment, etc., would all be impacted.  The agency also said medical debt is a poor predictor of being able to pay on another loan.

I have a friend who was told by a doctor's office that her estimated contribution for a procedure was 1,100 dollars.  The procedure happened.  She didn't get a bill.  She stopped by the office and the biller was out that day.  No bill until she got the bill from a collections agency.  She paid it.  But it still tanked her credit score so when she and her husband re-financed their mortgage, they only used her husband's credit. When they bought a used car, again, used just her husband.  It sucked.

""Unpaid medical bills will no longer appear on credit reports, where they can block people from mortgages, car loans or small business loans, according to a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will remove $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, according to the bureau, which means lenders will no longer be able to take that into consideration when deciding to issue a loan.

The change is estimated to raise the credit scores by an average of 20 points and could lead to 22,000 additional mortgages being approved every year, according to the bureau. Vice President¬†[Kamala Harris](https://apnews.com/hub/kamala-harris)¬†said in a statement announcing the rule that it would be ‚Äúlifechanging‚Äù for millions of families.

‚ÄúNo one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency,‚Äù she said.

Harris also announced that states and local governments have used a¬†[sweeping 2021 pandemic-era aid package](https://apnews.com/biden-relief-plan-major-victory-gets-mixed-one-year-reviews-310542ef5cddc914104960a00ae356e0)¬†to eliminate more than $1 billion in medical debt for more than 700,000 Americans.

The administration announced plans for the rule in fall 2023.

The CFPB said that medical debt is a poor predictor of an individual‚Äôs ability to repay a loan.¬†[Experian](https://fortune.com/company/experian-north-america/),¬†[Equifax](https://fortune.com/company/equifax/)¬†and¬†[TransUnion](https://fortune.com/company/transunion/), the three national credit reporting agencies, said last year that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.

m30mezv,22Cooper,"I'm an early 30s single guy with a solid income. I invest $1885.00 every Monday morning which amounts to roughly half of my take home pay, and I live off the other half.

I live in a very high cost of living city and I rent an apartment. I've got a very long time horizon so I'm trying to be aggressive.

Here is how I divvy my money:

Stock | Amount Invested | Percentage of investment
:--|:--:|--:
S&P 500 ETF (VOO) | $700 | 37.14%
NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM) | $400 | 21.22%
MAG 6 (no Tesla) | $180 ($30 each) | 9.55%
Small Caps (AVUV) | $120 | 6.37%
Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) | $100 | 5.30%
Financial Sector ETFs (XLF and IAI) * | $80 ($40 each) | 4.244%
Semiconductors ETF (SMH) | $80 | 4.244%
Individual Stock Picks I like (15 in total, listed below) ** | $225 ($15 each) | 11.94%
**TOTAL** | $1885 | 100%

*The difference between XLF and IAI is that XLF is mostly financial services such as JP Morgan Visa, Mastercard, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc..., whereas IAI is mostly brokers and securities dealers such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Schwab, S&P Global etc... There is only a 15% overlap between these two ETFs.

**The 15 companies I like that I invest $15 each into are: Adobe (ADBE), AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Chipotle (CMG), Salesforce (CRM), Door Dash (DASH), Netflix (NFLX), ServiceNow (NOW), Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Palantir (PLTR), Shopify (SHOP), Sofi Bank (SOFI), Uber (UBER)

---

I think at first glance, some will say that there is a little redundancy here, such as investing in the MAG 6 companies individually while also investing the majority of my money in VOO and QQQ which both contain the Mag 6 as their largest holdings each. This is a fair criticism, although I do this intentionally because I want more of a slant towards these companies so I get higher exposure by also investing in them individually, in addition to the exposure I get from the index funds.

I'm open to feedback from others. I'm trying to be aggressive in this portfolio which is why I invest in the Mag 6 and the 15 companies I like, while also trying to have some degree of diversification by putting 58.36% of my money in the S&P and Nasdaq, getting small cap exposure, exposure to the financial sector so that I am not exclusively in tech, and including bitcoin which is an entirely different asset class than equities (even though technically this is a stock that tracks the price of bitcoin, it is 100% linked to bitcoin).

Please provide any thoughts or constructive criticism below. Thank you",7,1734718760.0,1h403u4

I know its often recommended not to have this many individual stock and that I should only focus on my top 5 choices, but after tons of reading I think this portfolio will serve me well with some stocks providing above average growth, some providing dependable dividends, and others that I can use to hold for slow but steady growth that can also be used to write options with.

It's pushing buyers into defensive positions. 

It's impossible to parse out what Trump will do based on what Trump says. His advisors say that the tariffs will be limited. Then Trump puts out on social media that, actually, ‚ÄúThe story in the Washington Post, quoting so-called anonymous sources, which don‚Äôt exist, incorrectly states that my tariff policy will be pared back.

Those all need to be better than good. They need to be a great process and great products. 18A needs to be great to lure customers, panther/falcon need to be great to stop bleeding and start to rebuild brand confidence. 

Secondly, IFS needs its own board of directors and more formal separation from Intel‚Äôs design business. If trust is an issue, then Intel needs to address that issue in a more forceful and fundamental way than providing assurances that Intel won‚Äôt steal IP or use any info gained to their advantage. Intel really can‚Äôt do that immediately. The foundry needs customers first. 

1) hit 18A out of the park
2) make panther lake something everyone wants. Make falcon shores a more competitive product that is more easily scaled. 
2) new board and formal separation for IFS. Eventually once IFS has enough customers, intel needs to spin it off into a totally separate company. Intel shareholder then own Intel and IFS. Those businesses may be worth more apart than together.

m5zvun9,isinkthereforeiswam,"disclosure, I own some Intel

Intel will come back, but it will be a slog.

But, Intel is one of the few large companies remaining that hasn't sky-rocketed from the AI boom. A lot of folks see that as a huge negative. I mean.. a chip maker and comp sci tech company not booming during the AI boom is a huge red flag.

And it is.

But, it's b/c they're going through some issues.

Once they work their issues out, they'll be able to finally ride the escalator up.

It'll take a few things...

1) they need to eat some humble pie and start accepting that they've made some horrible plays. Their c-suite seems to be mentally stuck in their hey days, but seems to slowly be coming around to the fact that they're no longer the biggest d\*\*\* swinging in the room.

2) they're working on shifting their products around.. but, good lord, their latest CES showings make it clear they still suck at marketing. Folks on Ars Technica article commented ""If everything is Core Ultra, then what's the point of calling it Core Ultra?"" Also, they said that Intel is like walking into a restaurant with a 5 page menu showing what teh kitchen can make. Shorten that product list. There should be a low, med, high value option. Intel is still hyper-segmenting their products too much. And they named them in confusing fashion.

3) their work in GPU lets them catch-up some, but Nvidia is king of GPU right now. However, Nvidia is playing catch-up in CPU. But, Intel and AMD both are gpu/cpu, so Intel needs to find ways to leverage that.

4) Nvidia, AMD & Intel all recently invested in a private company that makes photonic chip relays (?), which means they're all-in on ways to speed-up GPU data transfer. I think the chip relay basically lets a bunch of GPU's, ASICs, etc all act like a large virtual pool of resource that AI orchastrators can farm work to. So, Intel is still working and partnering with the other companies and on smaller companies they all invest in.

5) Intel needs to read between the lines at things other companies aren't doing and focus on that. Nvidia and AMD already have AI + Robotics going. (AMD is partnered with Blackberry on robotics). IoT is a thing. But, if Intel could find some way to leverage AI in a new way or find smaller companis that do so, it could provide a niche it needs to grow.

6) Intel dragging might be the fire lit under its butt to speed up R&D on other things, like neuropmorphic cpu's or what not... something to help them stand out and find a niche to get ahead on.

The real question is will Intel get their act together before the AI boom ends or not. If they don't, then they'll probably be riding $20-25 or $30 for a long time. But, if they can get their s\*\*\* together, then they're the next company that will ride the escalator up as the demand for AI is out-stripping what all the AI companies can provide.

m5z7gic,Secapaz,"I'm not going to stress my brain with financial scientific mobo jumbo. But here's the street jist:

Big-Gov says we have a stronger than expected ""market"" (jobs, blah blah) and decline in unemployment to something (whatever is ""historically low""). This says our economy is growing healthy. 

More jobs = more household income (does it really? I dunno, flipping more burgers might? who knows)
This increase does (somehow???) increase consumer spending on goods, services, and investments(terrible investments like $500 shoes, and overpriced cars, oh and some houses, perhaps hookers but that's only serviceable in 1-2 areas in the USA). 

Strong employment says there is an increase in demand for goods/services (yeah, i suppose i need that extra car wash every 2 weeks).
Businesses expand operations; hire more people (those 18 year olds definitely need that gig at walmart).

Since the goody good data has come out, the market (well that's us, institutions, market makers, sonic the hedgehog, Goku, etc) expects a pause on rate cuts. Hell, there may even be a rate hike (Yikes!!!) because, well, that's the only way the FED thinks inflation can be controlled (how about every administration stop doing what every administration has done since the 70s...handing out free money for way too long and require that you must do MORE than the minimum to stop receiving this free money - unless of course you are disabled beyond the ability to hold a considerable job). 

Treasury -
Some investors who are into bonds may adjust to the chances or likelyhood that rates go up in the future. 
Some selling pressure goes up, why? Well, because big daddy cool bucks with old person's money try to lock in current rates before yields rise. 

But these yields go up because treasury issuers need to offer higher returns...why? Well, it attracts more buyers. Like enticing kids with candy (oh, wait, my bad...i know nothing of that).

Well, low and behold, treasury yields rise. Due to the expectation of the FED rates and possible inflation, the 10-year goes up.
How this impacts cash-flow is basically high yields make treasuries more attractive over low-yield savings accounts or whatever dividend stock is the flavor of the week. Money then leaves equities and flows into treasuries, unlike oil flowing into water.  This increases demand for higher yields because the money(buyers) demand it. 

Another thing is that mortgage rates are influenced by treasury yields. As that yield rises, mortgage rates rise. And this decreases the new income (funny how the government has devised a way to keep us all on this treadmill, but I like to look at it like a mouse wheel)

These moves scare people. You may see people investing in things like gold or real estate while moving away from stock assets. The higher yields cause stock prices to fall because of the so called risk free rate. So investors move into treasury instead of stocks. Like even mutual funds will reallocate cash into bonds to help their return for their customers grow. 

Basically, everyone moves their money in another direction so expectations of EVEN A NICE report on NVIDIA ends up not moving the needle much because, hey, we are all on the Treasury train until that train derails inevitably.

m5t63zq,greenpride32,"There is 100 years of statistical data that shows the largest gains in the broader market occur in a very small percentage of days.  For example, if you took out the 10 best performing days in a given year, the person who invested the whole year would have substantially higher return then a person who missed just those 10 days.

Timing the market is very difficult.  I have been an individual investor for over 25 years.  I've gone through dot com boom and bust, the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID pandemic.  

It was very difficult to want to buy stocks after the dot com rout.   But I learned over time that holding successful companies for the long term is the simplest strategy to win.  I started holding stocks long term and during 2008 and early 2020 I bought more of solid stocks that tanked.  

I think the key is to keep money in the markets long term - and to always have emergency funds on the side. You can perhaps use a porition of the emergency fund on a substantial stock market decline - but I wouldn't bank on it.  In just over 25 years I'd call it 3 major opportunities I've had.  Parking a substantial amount of cash in waiting would have cost me much larger market returns over time.

I remember holding AAPL shares in 2008-09 worth around $190/share at the time (not adjusted for what would be future splits).  As the markets tanked the stock went down to $80-ish.  Now in theory if I had all the cash on hand and bought at $80, my return would be maximied - brilliant right?  Now realistically what are the odds I would have called bottom and knew $80 was the right time to push in all the chips?  The odds are near zero.

During COVID crash, I held onto all my shares I've been accumulating since 2008-09-ish (when I stopped trading in and out) and they came out higher in the end.

It's common to have several accounts to organize money. An account where salary is directly deposited is used to pay bills, an emergency account, one or more accounts for saving towards specific goals, one or more taxable brokerage accounts for participating in markets in various ways (e.g., investing, trading).

I'm assuming that you are referring to cash reserves in a taxable brokerage account. Selling assets to raise cash is a common way to reduce risk. This often coincides with reducing risk prior to expected weakness to buy at better valuations. You might also sell assets periodically to rebalance your positions.

Let's say you have a 100K account for easy math. You buy 50 shares of abc stock at 100 for a 5% position. After some time, the value of abc stock has increased to 120, so your position is now 6%, assuming that's your only position to keep the example simple. Your account is now 101K due to appreciation of abc position. You sell 8 shares, which reduces your position size back to 5%.

If you had a spread of investments that were always in a positive return, and had several you felt you were comfortable cashing out to shift positions... then go ahead.

I personally dabble in investing. I got lucky with a few wins lately. I'm sitting on my cash for now. Partly b/c wife and I have a big ticket purchase coming up. But, also b/c I don't want to have my money tied up in something that might be getting 1% if I wait a few days, and then I miss something that dropped and bounced back 10%.

There was someone that made another post saying they just ""wait for the bad days"". They're looking at the top 200 of the S&P 500, and just waits for one of the companies to have a ""bad day"" where investors bail. Then he has cash on-hand to buy the dip that day, and flip it later.

It's always nice to have some cash on-hand. Stock sales can happen fast, but knowing you got the cash right then to pounce on something is a fantastic feeling.

That said, I try to follow that old rule of only having like 5-10% of my investment assets in cash. I do like money working for me when it's invested.

However, if you're doing it for something like F or AAL and you fundamentally believe in those companies and would feel comfortable buying them at your buy price, than you should continue doing it.

The wheel part is buying the stock (100 shares) and then sell covered calls against your shares, and then eventually your shares get called away. At that point you can sell a put option and then eventually get assigned shares that you then sell covered calls against. 

You earn premiums with the options and also continue to realize your cyclical gains.

The long term investments, I usually don't really take profit from growth, and either reinvest dividends elsewhere, or take dividends into a money market account or bonds. I also collect some premium on these investments by selling options.

I typically start taking profit on the short term investments on the basis of a percentage increase in the underlying of about 15-25%. I do this with certain options too. That profit gets invested into one of the long term investments I mentioned above. 

If you ever have a credible reason to consider that one of your very profitable investments is a ""hype"" investment, imo you should take profit, especially a large percentage gain or before a event that causes a change in volatility. I learned this in the dot com era when some of my investments (JDS Uniphase) lost essentially all their value after I could have realized a large gain. Nowadays I also don't care at all if a stock I sold after 25% gain goes on a huge run. Profit is profit to me, and long term, more stable (theoretically) investments are more attractive to me now.

m5rf8bx,GermantownTiger,"Retired Wall Street vet with a few suggestions:

As others have stated, always re-evaluate your investment thesis for every holding in your portfolio about once a year or so.

Establish trailing stop-losses for each position to allow your winners to run while still protecting you from catastrophic downside losses. You can establish your own stop-loss system and/or subscribe to a service that does this for you. Whatever you do, use closing prices that you track separately from the exchanges...don't show your hand by entering stop-loss trades in the market.

Ex: Assuming you want to place a 20% trailing stop loss and you buy a stock at $10, your initial stop-loss is $8. Assuming the stock goes up to $15, your new trailing stop loss is now $12. From there let's assume the stock goes to $25, your new trailing stop is now $20 (and so forth and so on). This allows you to capture some nice upside while preventing the mistake of riding one of your ""babies"" all the way back down to where you started (or lower).  While not perfect, it's a disciplined approach that reduces the emotional issue as to when to sell a stock. Ideally, you keep this type of buy-and-hold strategy in place until a trailing loss is triggered, thus allowing you to reap the benefit of 2x, 5x and 10x types of returns.

Another related strategy is to use proper position sizing when constructing your investment portfolio. Allocate no more than 3-5% of your portfolio to any single position (maybe 1-2% for more speculative opportunities) while also diversifying among a broad range of industries and asset classes. Of course, you may have a more significant position size with things like real estate and/or other business interests. This strategy will help protect you from general market pullbacks that are sure to occur every several years or so. ""Prepare, Don't Predict.

Let's also assume you've employed proper position sizing but due to some outsized gains on a winner here and there, this one position now comprises 10-15-20% of your total portfolio. What a wonderful problem to have, right?! If you're like me, I'm always re-evaluating things for other opportunities and I might consider taking some nice long-term gains on part of my position to add to my cash holdings while reducing that position's size back to the 3-5% territory...I'll also attempt to sell a losing position in that same tax year to help offset some of the gain I'm taking (of course it doesn't matter if I take profits in a non-taxable account, so loss harvesting isn't necessary).

Lastly, learn to sell/write deep out-of-the money puts with cash you keep on the sidelines (I always keep some dry powder ready to rumble). This is a strategy I've used for going on 2 decades now and has made me MANY tens of thousands in extra cash. The key is to ONLY write puts on GREAT companies you wouldn't mind owning if the price were to fall at the lower strike prices. I typically like to go out about 30-45 days on my expirations and look for strike prices about 10-20% lower than current market values (maybe a bit more or less depending on the underlying volatility of the stock). You can easily learn how to do this yourself or you can pay for various services to make suggestions for you. I prefer to gather my own research from trusted paid resources, but I always remember to maintain diversification and sound position sizing with this strategy as well.

m5lujpm,AntoniaFauci,"Some here will be old enough to remember when google was mind blowing.  Their search was so much better than yahoo/AltaVista/etc.  They needed articles to explain how it could be so good and so fast.  They developed their own data-center-in-a-sea-can, and edge networking, and so many advancements.  

When gmail launched on April 1 2004, most people thought it was an April Fools prank because the idea of free email was almost unthinkable, and the storage capacities it offered didn‚Äôt sound possible.  At the time, paying $20+ a month for email was normal, a figure that would be about $40+ today.  And it had a counter in the corner showing that the amount of free email storage you had was growing faster than you could use it.

Every month or two, google would have a new free feature that felt like wizardry.  And when they‚Äôd announce something, it was because it was available that very day, not some futurist fantasy.  

Dictionaries, encyclopedias, maps, these were software products people would pay good money on CD ROMs.  Google just dished it out for free.  And it was live and updating constantly.

Google maps of your own city, bam.  Google Earth.  Street View.  

Sketchup.  Picasa.  And so on.

Then came all the ancillary products.  YouTube, Google Docs, Chrome, Android, Google Finance.  Super clean interfaces, UX, presentations, integration.  That thing where you start to type and it started to fill in various predictions.  Their social media thing was well designed, even if it never became popular.  

Their hiring and recruiting and workplace cultures were inspiring, revolutionary.  If you were around and aware of tech at the time, you get what I‚Äôm saying.

And then that all kind of stopped, and the era of Pichai and enshittification began.  Goodbye sketchup.  Goodbye Picasa.  Goodbye music.  

It‚Äôs been forever since google has announced or released anything imaginative or useful.  

And they‚Äôve steadily crappified everything they do have.  Image search is junk.  Search is useless. Cached versions of sites appears to be gone.  Everything is an ad.    YouTube buffers more than Mitch McConnell.  And YouTube itself is a soap opera, if you can even get past the ad walls.  Skipping ads after 2 seconds became 5 seconds became 15 seconds became No skip.

Say you wanted to buy AAPL at $150.  You would call your broker, it would ring for 10 seconds, then pick up.  You'd explain your order to the broker, limit buy AAPL at $150.  Your order still was not even placed.  The broker would then maybe try to talk you out of the position, tell you to buy NVDA instead if you want to make some real money.  After some discussions, you decided to keep with limit buy AAPL at $150.  So then the broker would instruct his traders in the pit at New York to buy you some AAPL shares at $150.  The thing is you would have no idea when the buy would be executed, until you got confirmation later.  So, say AAPL drops to $140 intraday.  There is no way you could sell because you didn't even know if you owned the shares yet.

Eventually your buy order went through, and you got charged $200 commission for dealing with all this bullshit.  So I hope you were buying at least 400 shares @ 150/share, or you're well underwater already.

Eventually you would sell, go through all the talking and explaining and waiting again, the broker would say you should hedge your position instead of closing it, bullshit about future iPhone sales expectations and AI (for Apple Intelligence, natch), and get charged another $200 commission.

Schwab came up with no advice heavily discount service. Place your order $35.00 per trade for 100 s or less.  How much is the stock now?  They respond: $19. You shout back sell at market price. They repeat what you order on a recorder.  On the exchange floor was another story. I never witness it on Wall Street but I think there were a lot hand gestures on prices from these traders not too much shouting like in the movies.  Anything under 1 block of 100s often get transferred to the broker who is out on the floor looking for another one broker to strike a deal. I became appreciating how hard it is to make a living as a stock trader.  I may add Schwab the discount brokerage had a (415) area code long distance phone number not 800 ac. $35 trade is cheap but the people waiting on a long distance line can mean $5-7 dollars on top of $35.

Today, I think 58% American families own some kind of equity. Unaware if it includes 401K or not. In 2000 only 20% families owned stock so you are not alone.  In the 1990s the ownership was 15%, and prior decade was even lower around 10%.

m5m0bk3,direwolf71,"I was a registered representative (aka securities broker) at Schwab from 1997 to 2001, so just when the transition from broker assisted to internet trading was taking place.  

Schwab was known as a ‚Äúdiscount broker‚Äù and believe it or not, a vast majority of retail orders were placed via ‚Äútelebroker,‚Äù which was simply using a touch tone phone.  That was the cheapest option - $19.95 per trade IIRC. 

I was on a team that served active traders.  The service was called ‚ÄúSchwab 500‚Äù at the time because it was supposedly our 500 highest volume traders.  Anyway, most calls went like this after an introduction and account verification:

Customer: ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs AOL.‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúBidding 98 1/4, Ask is 98 1/2‚Äù

Customer: ‚ÄúBuy me 1,000 AOL at market.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúOk, in account 12345, buying 1,000 shares AOL at market, is that correct?‚Äù

Customer: ‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù

And done.  We could route orders to specific exchanges (P Coast, Philly and NYSE) and some customers would have notes in CRM like ‚Äúalways route to NYSE‚Äù and they‚Äôd use that to bust trades if you didn‚Äôt do it.

Everything was on a recorded line, so if a customer had a dispute, your manager would pull the tape. That‚Äôs why we had to read back every order. 

The active traders paid between $20 to $50 per trade.   Buy and holders called a different number and the average commission was probably closer to $100.  

It‚Äôs been a tick, but I think internet trading was initially $39 per trade up to 1000 shares than 3 cents per share over that.

You‚Äôd place trades in writing or over the phone.  Generally you‚Äôd give them max and min values and a future date of say a week or two out. If you did large enough orders or had a good relationship with your broker they might tell the recent price trader.  They expected you to use the correct lingo and they‚Äôd record your order on tapes as proof.  

 There was a system you could call after the end of the day and hear the status of your order, otherwise you‚Äôd just wait and be notified by mail.   

Commissions could be $50 or more per trade, so you‚Äôd have to be very good or do large trades so that the buy and sell commission didn‚Äôt eat your whole gain.  It was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to buy say $300 worth of a stock and know that you‚Äôd have to sell it for at least $400 before you‚Äôd be green. 

Brokers did 100 shares by default, also known as a board lot.  If you had a good relationship with a good broker they could try to do smaller lot sizes for you by convincing someone else to join your order at a similar price range.  

There was no real time pricing available to normal people.  Tickers were printed on paper, called a ticker tape.  For pricing you‚Äôd check the morning newspaper which showed the previous day‚Äôs info for each stock.

Respect the trend.  Never be in a long position below the 50 day moving average.  There is an exception but it still comes down to staying in the trend.

Sales forgives all.  Look for companies with double digit, and when you can get it, triple digit sales growth. Witness NVDA.

Be strict with limiting losses and only average up.  Never lose more than you would on a bad date, and only average up.  On the authority of Paul Tudor Jones I caution you: Losers average losers.

m5nskb5,AntoniaFauci,"A few things to know:  

* none of the people telling you stories are under oath
* sure, there are people who gambled in high gain stocks that have become 10 baggers, but that‚Äôs not necessarily disciplined investing
* if you did learn to invest and were disciplined and you are patient and you have a high risk tolerance, you too might buy into whatever the big 10x stock is for 2035... or 2045... or 2055.  You have a lifetime ahead of you.  Don‚Äôt FOMO.
* with stocks, there‚Äôs a tendency of big winner stories being public, while the other large majority of average or lower performers stay quiet

Don‚Äôt get complacent and expect 20% ROI every year.  Long term average is half of that, which means by probabilities there will be some 0% and some big negative years too.

That said, a committed, educated, disciplined person who is willing to put in the time and the capital and take the risks can outperform the averages.  

If you can continues your pace and *never* do better than 20% in a year, you‚Äôll become wealthy anyway.  With discipline and commitment, you don‚Äôt need 60% or 200% gains.  You can get rich slowly at first, then more quickly.

If that interests you, learn and learn and treat it like a job you want to be the best at.  Put in the hours.  Measure the hours spent versus the incremental extra gains.  In other words, if you being a self-investor makes you an extra $1000 a year but consumes 250 hours of your time (which should be the minimum), then frankly you‚Äôd be better off just buying ETFs and spending your time on a side job that pays more than $4/hour.

The advice I wish someone would have given me at 25 would have been to:  

* commit to stock marketinvestments and ignore CDs, fixed interest, t bills, bonds, etc
* live on a frugal budget and put every penny possible into a well managed stock portfolio
* assuming I have secure employment/prospects, use debt to lever up my stock market polio so I get a larger capital base sooner.  Note that this is a level of risk one should only do if they manage it well and are 100% capable of managing the debt and 100% mentally ok with starting over from zero if the leverage goes against you and you have to cash out your port to clear every penny of debt.

At the risk of being candid, making 20% on $1000 portfolio is basically meaningless.  Much better to be making 20% on a $250k portfolio, and so on. The sooner you can get to larger numbers, the better.

Plus there‚Äôs a thing that happens when a portfolio becomes a noticeable size, and when you‚Äôre living within your means to prioritize regular investments.  It becomes something yiure happy to do, not a burden.  You see progress.  When you get a raise or come into some money, your first thought isn‚Äôt about spending it on depreciating things like vehicles or clothes or partying.

m5l8fqv,steamingpileofbaby,"I bought cannabis stocks in 2016 which returned 10x in 2.5 years. Afterwards, I did a little better than the market up until 2021 when I allocated 25% of my capital into stocks I knew I shouldn't have. In 2022 I got crushed in comparison to the S&P 500. The last 2 years I've done better but underperforming in 2021 and getting crushed in 2022 set me behind compared to if I had just invested 100% in the S&P 500 in 2021. 

If you want to greatly outperform the market you have to concentrate your money into a few stocks or 1 sector and be right. If you're wrong in the beginning it will be very difficult to catch up to what you would have had if you just invested in the S&P 500. 

So if you want 5x-10x gains you have to be patient and selective but also be right. I read some books and consumed a lot of information on risk and market behaviour which helped me to navigate investing in cannabis stocks. But lack of experience and optimism from years of good market performance enables costly mistakes.

My upbringing had no finance knowledge but I got a lot of passive real estate knowledge albeit my parents really had no clue about economics nor how to tie anything into investing in stocks or what have you. All they knew is ""House Good. You must buy now!"" LoL. Your question will garner answers that are all over the place but we are in a bubble right now so a lot of new investors think they are geniuses. Hint... they arent... it was just lucky timing.

Ill give you mine but again, dont take this as normal just as what can be done even without formal education... actually to tell you the truth, not having a finance background probably helped me because it I didnt have many of their biases. Anyway....

I had $30k in 2008 in treasuries. End of 2008, I withdrew and started investing into the financial crash. At the of end of 2023 that $30k was was north of $10m. Its hard for me to pinpoint exact because I pulled well over $500k when I ""retired"" for a while in my mid 30s before I got bored and went back to work. Also more than half of it was pulled into RE. 2024, my stock portfolio was up 74% while real estate was less impressive but I havent calculated the yoy with all that yet. I usually dont care. No one believes it anyway, so whats the point? Not like im going to magically be offered a high income job or anything.

Again this is all useless to you. Just because I was able to destroy even the best fund managers over the last 15 years, doesn't mean you can but if you just want to know what can be done, then there you go. My background is unusual in breadth. Dont feel like listing it here but in summary, im calculated, and when I fail, I keep doing it until I succeed. Doesnt matter what it is. Basket weaving?

50% growth in one year for this stock is absurdly high. It always has a high PE ratio for an established stock I just have trouble seeing that kind of growth in one year. 

To piggyback the established stock comment, you keep mentioning revenues, what about its net? If you‚Äôre talking about small cap stocks then yeah I can see the discussion about online growth but Disney has been around for decades and pays a dividend. IMO they stock trades based more on its bottom line than top line metrics but I do understand the market moves based on future outlook. 

I have just about every streaming services through my own wallet or shared accounts. Disney is used the least if at all. This is coming from a big marvel fan, enjoyer of Star Wars, and lover of National Geographic. To be honest, it just doesn‚Äôt have great rewatchability for me and a lot of the products have gone downhill. Marvel isn‚Äôt what it used to be. Same with Star Wars. Granted, I don‚Äôt have kids so maybe that will change when we do have kids. 

As for parks and cruises, I am a bonafide Disney hater in this aspect I will admit. I hate theme parks and spending my time off around crowds of fat smelly loud people etc. I also get weirded out by Disney adults. So I‚Äôm obviously biased here and will take your word on it all. 

Live sports seem like they‚Äôre years late to this. I will enjoy my NFL games on YouTube TV. I‚Äôd also consider the pirate life as well. Maybe it depends on the sport though. 

I can see the growth you‚Äôre seeing but Disney as a stock excites me less than an index fund. It feels more like an intel than a stock that‚Äôs going to triple in the next 5 years. However!

RKT and UWMC are two of those refinancing mortgage brokers.  I dislike both companies and their leaders.  They are basically rate sensitive instruments.  

RKT is interesting in that it‚Äôs down just about exactly 50% in a straight line since Sept.  If one subscribes to Fib theory on levels, that becomes interesting.  The collapse in the price mirrors expectations of mortgage rates. 

What if maybe the selloff is overdone now,  and what if the next admin pushes rate cutting at all costs that meaningfully does affect long rates?  Maybe this dog is ready to bounce? It‚Äôs how I felt about another dumpster fire PYPL a year ago.

If one likes RKT, UWMC is basically the same company but structured to pay a whopping 7% yield.  Sure, they could yank that at any moment but it‚Äôs something that parking in RKT doesn‚Äôt offer.

With that said, after 2 weeks of recovery, I wrjt back to work at our covid quarantine unit. At that time, I was the only one to have gotten it. Got paid nice in the quarantine unit, too. Peaceful as well.

We had about 20 beds, our own entrance exit, only admissions i received were confirmed covid patients, and for better or worse, most were pretty chill with it. I sadly saw many die, tried to save many as well. Seen people decline within an hour super fast.. pulse ox gradually going down.. was crazy. Quite a few survived, too! Some needed o2 for months, yesrd after, some fully recovered.

Nice bonuses of hundreds of dollars, no other bullshit interruptions from management staff. I was on my own island with my loan cna. We had a little isolated break room as well.

I'd pick up shifts, bonus for covid, bonus for picking up, and relieve my buddy for 12 hours. He'd come back and relieve me. Did this for months.. I dont think I've ever had such a lucrative time working.

So while others had to close shit down and quarantine, isolate, lack in person interaction... I still went out and worked, so my perspective on covid seems to be much different than most.

At first it was because the food was going to be thrown out anyway, but over time, they made deliberate servings for us. I got to talk to a lot of the cooks, in the evening before they went home, and they learned what we liked, and even in the daytime when we dropped by, we could often get a free lunch.

m60vgd5,movieguy95453,"When you say nighr shift, do you swing shift from around 4:00pm to midnight? Or do you mean graveyard - or overnight?

For swing shift the main benefit is you have plenty to time to deal with doctors appointments and anything else where you deal with businesses open 9-5 Monday through Friday. If you work 9-5, dealing with this stuff usually means using your sick time and/or pto.

I haven't worked a ton of graveyard shifts, but i hated them when i did because you're literally running on a different schedule from most of the rest of the world. 

If you live in a city, swings or graves probably arent too bad because there is a whole subculture of people who work the same shifts. You can lead a pretty normal life, including a social life. 

In a small town it can be pretty isolating because there aren't usually a lot of people working similar shifts, and many social hangouts are going to be closed when you're off. If you need child care it can be hard to find.",5,1736328061.0,1hwe96w

I do a shift and then come home at like 6am. I've not got any notifications overnight because everyone's asleep, I don't have to reply to emails or do anything. There's no drama, no gossip. Overnight I'm at work and that's all I have to deal with.

I then go to sleep at say 0730 and I sleep through the entire day. Noones speaking to me, noones asking me stuff, I don't have to deal with crowds of people or make decisions. If the phone rings I'm asleep so I don't answer. Friends and family know I'm asleep so don't expect any replies or anything from me. 

Also I live alone now, but when I lived with an SO it's just chilled out. I come in from work and the morning and maybe see her for a bit as she's getting up for work, then I go to sleep and have an empty quiet house to myself. When I wake up she's usually still out so I get up when I want, eat whenever I want, slob out on the sofa watching bullshit TV, then head into work.

It was my front door opening. I sat up and listened, not sure I was actually hearing what I thought I was, but sure enough I heard someone walk right in. They immediately walked straight to my bedroom and to both of our horror, we made eye contact as I nearly shit myself and clearly they almost did too. Immediately they ran out and I stood there frozen in shock from seeing the guy who did my oil change a few months ago. 

A few months earlier I had gone to a Jiffy Lube for an oil change and the same man who helped me, was the same guy who made his way into my apartment.

We got to the location and the bridge had been out of use for a long time. It was overgrown and had no trespassing signs all over it. Adjacent to it was a big overgrown field. 

We were already giddy about the crybaby bridge thing so stuff already felt spooky. I joked that that field looks like a good spot to dump a body. Nobody would ever think to look back there. I also dared my friend to go out there and look around.

Fast forward a couple of weeks and he is released into the custody of his mother, basically on house arrest. He escapes house arrest and is awol for a couple of hours. It was a school day and my school went in to full lockdown and I was placed in the office of the principal while school staff patrolled the hallway. He was found and again placed into custody. Shortly after that, he was again released from custody into the care of his mother. Less than 24 hours later he had attacked a young girl he did not know and sliced her neck. She made a full recovery, as far as I know.

During the trial hearing he was not convicted for trying to kill me, as I was not at home. Later, a more senior court picked the case back up. It was revealed that his mother had written a letter to the authorities explaining that he had been talking about trying to kill me again, and had said that it was a mistake that I was not at home during the first incidence. He was then convicted for attempted murder. 

He has a very low IQ and many mental health issues, and he will remain in protective custody for the rest of his life. He wanted to kill me because he had delusions about me suing him for sexual harassment and other issues, all of which never happened.

A nondescript man, maybe in his mid-30s, approached the gate. I don't know if it was because I was closer to the gate or what, but he saw me and called out to get my attention. 

Something in me screamed not to get closer, so I talked to him while standing about 15-feet away from the fence. He told me he knew my dad, and he'd been sent to pick me up. 

I was a gullible kid, so I believed him. I was gonna get out of school early! I started to walk towards him, but last second I realized - you can't leave school without signing out! 

So I told him he had to meet me in the office and don't worry, I'll tell the teacher he's here to pick me up!

I was super excited about getting out of school early for a day, so I went over to the teacher who was monitoring recess and happily told her my dad's friend was here to pick me up and there he is! 

The SUV took off right as I told her, and I seriously thought the guy was moving the car to park so he could go to the office and sign me out. 

The teacher ended recess immediately, calling us all in, which i thought was odd because it didn't seem like it had been as long as normal. 

The guy never did sign me out, and I was really disappointed.

Alexander Graham Bell made a metal detector to try and find the bullet, but the doctor would allow him to do the right side of the body, where that believe the bullet was.

m61h3yx,Furaskjoldr,"More unsettling than straight up creepy but very weird. 

I'm an EMT and at the time worked in a middle sized university town. Lots of student houses and other cheap housing, shared houses etc. 

One night at probably around 3am we got sent to a very average house on a very average street. The only information we'd been passed was that there was blood everywhere and the caller thinks their housemate had cut themselves. 

We arrived at basically the exact same time as the police (assume they got sent due to mention of a knife being potentially used, not sure). We went in behind them, and the house was like *covered* in blood. It wasn't like thick everywhere, but there were drops all over the floor, it was smudged up every single wall. I've seen plenty of blood in this job and this was relatively fresh. Some of it was congealed, a lot of it was still liquid but none of it was dried so I'd guess it would've been around an hour or so since it got there. 

Downstairs in the house was one bedroom, a living room, and a kitchen with a back door going into the garden. Upstairs was a bathroom and 3 other bedrooms all individually rented and occupied by people who probably didn't really know each other that well. Pretty common arrangement in Europe for young adults and people without enough money to rent their own apartment.

The girl in the room downstairs had called. She said she had woken up to go upstairs to use the toilet and seen blood everywhere. She said the guy who lived in the room above hers was 'mental' and had been in hospital a few times for cutting/stabbing himself.

Sure enough upstairs, there's blood too everywhere. Cops went to the end room where this guy stayed. Knocked on the door, and after a short while he answered, wearing his underwear, half asleep, and absolutely fine. No injuries on him at all. Cops explain why we're all here outside his room at 3am and he says he has no idea about any of it. Agrees to let the cops search his room and nothing.

Other residents hear the ruckus outside and come out to see what's going on, all of them are fine with the cops searching their room and there's nothing untoward. They all say they were asleep until we rocked up. There's no blood in any of the bedrooms. Just the common areas.

Cops search the rest of the house and find nothing else besides more blood. There's no attic or basement. Back garden door is locked, and when they go out there's no blood in the garden or on the door.

Cops call a dog to the scene to try and search for any scent as obviously we're all pretty freaked out and concerned by this time. Dog arrives, and picks up a scent in the house, goes all over the house, seemed to have a really good track on it, upstairs and downstairs everywhere, and tracks really strongly to the front door, then when it gets to the doorstep it just stops and turns around and goes back inside. Handler said it just seems like the track stopped at the front door. Cops asked if anything else had been reported nearby, dispatch said no.

At that point we had no patient to treat and there were other calls waiting so our dispatch just sent us elsewhere. Never did find out what happened. 

Would love to have been able to see what happened in that house though overnight, and dread to think what the girl might've found if she left her room to go to the toilet an hour or so earlier.",239,1736340333.0,1hwbx6g
m61mpci,HIPPIECHINP,"Sorry for long post

Looking back, I think I might have narrowly avoided being trafficked during a layover in Istanbul a few years ago.

It was peak COVID times, and I (20f at the time) had a 17 hour transit at Istanbul airport on my way home. Being new to connecting flights, I decided to stay in the airport rather than book a hotel.

Before my first flight, a middle-aged, friendly-looking lady struck up a conversation with me. She asked about my destination and, coincidentally, was headed to the same place. She mentioned visiting a friend for vacation, which felt odd given that return flights were being canceled left and right. But she seemed nice, so I didn't think much of it.

When we landed in Istanbul, I deliberately hung back to avoid more small talk, but she waited for me near the transit zone. She asked where I was staying and insisted I come with her, saying it was her first connecting flight and she felt nervous alone in a foreign country. She even mentioned having a luxury hotel room.

I politely declined‚Äîmainly because the idea of spending the night with a stranger felt weird, not because I was creeped out (yet). She kept pressing, though, and then asked me to help her find the exit to passport control, claiming she didn't speak English.

I decided to pass her off to an airline staff member at the information desk. The guy asked me if I knew her, and when I said no, he escorted her away.

I thought that was the end of it, but while waiting for my boarding gate the next morning, she reappeared‚Äîthis time with a bag of fruit, insisting I eat some. I refused again.

When we finally landed at our destination, she stuck by my side the entire way through arrivals, even waiting for my luggage long after she'd gotten hers. I kept telling her to go ahead, but she wouldn't.

Then, as we walked into the arrivals area, I spotted my fiancee and waved to him. When I turned back to say goodbye to her, she was gone.

It only hit me later, after telling the story to my fiancee and watching a documentary on human trafficking, how fd up that situation could have been. I guess my introversion might‚Äôve saved me that day.

To be honest, until this day I'm not sure a traffiking was the thing in this situation. I still hope she was just a strange friendly lady. But giving sircumstances, it was creepy af.",81,1736342676.0,1hwbx6g
m6179tu,ca_pulettes,"I worked the night shift at a county jail back in 2018-2020. It was my first job. So, I've had creepy experiences both real and maybe imagined. 

There were certain parts of this jail that gave me the creeps. Like the filing cabinet building (the dungeon) that used to be the old jail. You always felt like you were being closely watched and followed around in that area. 

A couple coworkers and an inmate told me separately that an inmate hung himself because he was sentenced to life in prison for murder and he didn't want to go. He hung himself in the old part of the jail. 

Every once in a while, we would get the intercom pinging in random cells that we knew no inmates were housed. There was one time I answered the detox cell and we just heard someone take a deep breath in on the other side. My coworker went to go check out the cell to be sure and no one was there. 

A couple months later, I went to gather some blankets and hygiene products so we could be prepared. As I walked back to the control room where my coworker was, I saw an inmate in oranges hunched over in the visitation room (that room is like a small utility closet with windows so inmates could talk to visitors). It was 8 pm so an hour into my shift and I immediately thought there's no way we missed someone waiting here for us to relocate him. 

I stopped and walked backwards to peer into the window and no one was there. The door was even locked so I unlocked it to look around. Nothing. He didn't look like an ""apparition."" I wasn't hallucinating. I was wide awake. I felt like I saw a real person there. 

A trustee who was in the laundry room where their television was said, ""You saw him, too, didn't you?"" I asked him about it and he gave the accurate description of him. Bald, skinny, tall. ""Yeah, we see him back here every once in a while, always at night. Don't know who he is or was."" 

A couple of weeks later, I was sitting in the control room. It was around 2 am. All the inmates were sleeping. My coworker went back to the trustee pod to chat with them. I got up to grab my water bottle in the adjacent office and as I walked past the window, I saw the tall, thin, bald young man standing in the booking area via my peripheral. When I looked back, he wasn't there anymore. My coworker came around the corner and went out to check the booking area but found no one in there and there was nowhere for someone to slip out, either. 

This was all creepy and true but unexplainable to this day. I've searched up the suicide and never found anything on that nor anything about who that man was. Maybe it was swept under the rug.

m61ccst,BobDolesSickMixtape,"So, when I was a kid... maybe like 3rd or 4th grade, don't exactly remember... in the house where we lived at the time, which was a 1-story house, my bed was inexplicably set right by a window facing the front yard. I have no idea what the hell my mom was thinking when she set up my bedroom like that. Thankfully, she changed that shortly after this story occurred.

So one night, I'm trying to sleep, and I hear some shuffling around outside. I'm already a paranoid kid, because I'd watch America's Most Wanted with my parents sometimes and thought every robber and murderer and home invader on there was out to come find us and kill us or whatever, and it's like the middle of the night. I get up the courage to look through the blinds, and I see someone running out into the front yard from the back (my brother's room was across from mine, facing the backyard, but it definitely wasn't him).

So the guy stops to look around, not sure if he was trying to figure out where to go next, or if he was looking for someone or something. Anyway, he sees me looking at him through my window, and I freak out and hide under the covers like a genius, instead of doing something silly, like going to get my parents (although their bedroom was on the other side of the house, so I guess maybe I thought this guy would get me if I tried to leave my room, too. I was a stupid kid).

Moments later I hear the guy pounding the shit out of my window and screaming... something. I just remember the screaming, not the actual words. Which, on the bright side, my parents heard - probably helped that they were actually still up and watching TV in the living room, but they ran right into my room, pulled me out of my bed, and took me into the living room while they called 911 (my dad did, anyway; my mom had the bright idea to hang back in my room and scream threats at the very angry and violent guy, because of course she did).

Lucky thing is the police were already on their way to the neighborhood anyway because someone else called about this guy going around and harassing people, and just acting suspiciously. Apparently he was trying to find his ex-wife's house and take their kids from her, and he didn't know which house in the neighborhood was hers; just that she lived there. (Except she actually didn't; she lived in a different neighborhood. Her street name just happened to be very similar to ours.)

We hauled it all the way up there and threw it in the pile. When we turned around to head back in through the side door, I saw a figure on the trampoline, sitting completely upright. It looked as if it were sitting cross legged with a straight back. Its shape was human, but it didn‚Äôt have any discernible features from that far away. It looked like it was covered in a thin tan sheet. 

When I paused, she kept talking and walking. I grabbed out for her, and she froze. Looked at me, then in the direction I was looking in. We always had a codeword. A ‚ÄúNo fucking around, this is serious‚Äù codeword. When she said it, we both booked it for the front door instead. 

No one believed us. She was in hysterics and I was just shocked. It was hard to sleep that night. 

I still have no idea what that was. No way it was an animal, it had shoulders. And a head.",340,1736330733.0,1hwbx6g
m61iwcw,TheSilentHiker,"Another fairly recent story happened when I arrived as the first responder at a bicycle accident. An elderly woman was lying on the street in a massive puddle of thick blood, which was visibly growing, even though it was already about half a meter in diameter. Another person was there, but they kept their distance because of the gruesome scene. They gestured to me, indicating they had already called an ambulance.

I knelt down and tried to talk to the woman, who was only able to make faint, miserable sounds. It was a horrifying mess. Her face and head were disfigured, her teeth broken and scattered on the ground. Her face displayed a horrifying spectrum of colors‚Äîpurple, blue, greenish, and yellow‚Äîbruises everywhere, all covered in blood of various consistencies: foamy, thick, thin, dark, light, clotted. Blood was pouring from wounds all over her, and in some of them, the bare bone was visible. It was clear she was dying.

I focused on the largest wound at the back of her head, trying to staunch the worst of the bleeding while her face continued to swell. She mumbled that she was tired and wanted to sleep, but I kept talking to her, asking questions and encouraging her to stay awake. By this point, I was covered in blood myself. Other people who had arrived kept their distance but helped in other ways, like offering to guide the emergency responders to the scene, which was difficult to access by car.

One woman handed me her handbag to use as makeshift pressure on the head wound but quickly walked away afterward. The ambulance arrived relatively quickly‚Äîwithin about 15 minutes‚Äîbut it felt like an hour. I still remember collecting her teeth and fragments of them from the street as we waited, not knowing if they might somehow be saved.

The emergency team took over, and within 10 minutes, they were gone with the woman, leaving nothing but the massive puddle of blood and her bicycle lying nearby. I locked the bicycle to a fence and went home to wash off the blood. The entire situation felt surreal.

The accident had happened on my way to work, so I passed by the scene daily. For weeks, I could see the dried bloodstain until the rain finally washed it away. I never found out what happened to the old woman. Since I never saw her again, I fear the worst, but who knows? Her locked bicycle disappeared three or four days later. She had mentioned that she had no family and lived alone, so I can only assume it was either stolen or removed by the owner of the fence.",54,1736341111.0,1hwbx6g

In this entry way was a group of about 6 young men. A single girl walks in obviously drunk and on her phone. The boys surround her and ask her to hang out. She says no and they begin taunting her, touching her, pulling at her hair. She starts to cry knowing there is nothing she can do. 

I knew I couldn‚Äôt live with myself if anything happened so I walked over, silently grabbed her arm, and walked her over to our corner where I held her. She just cried and I told her I‚Äôd be taking her home with us.

m615rhb,TiredCVT,"I worked ( no longer, this is a few years ago now ) at a hole in the wall bar in Southwest Florida as my first job. You could serve alcohol at 18 for those raising a brow. I have met a lot of normal people, but a few scarier individuals that left me uneasy. 

One of those people is someone I only met once but still vividly remember because he had facial/neck tattoos and was charming on a surface level. His vibe was off though. He had asked me and a few of the other girls I was working with if we wanted to hang out once the bar closed. I declined reluctantly. He seemed irritated but let it go, my other coworkers also declined.

This same person murdered two women a very short time later. A fellow bartender at a different bar five minutes up the road and a woman he'd met at a bar in a different city over the river ( 15 minute drive ). The other bartender he killed in cold blood, luring her to his car only to strangle her, shove her out, repeatedly run her over and dump her in the field right by the bar. 

He has been given the death penalty as of this year and I still think about the fact that it could have been me if I hadn't listened to my gut. I was a huge people pleaser and hated disappointing others - really easily gave in to pressure at that young age. 

That is the only one that really sits at the forefront of my memory.

When we got closer we realized that one of these ""trees"" was not a tree. It let out a loud screech and ran into the woods. Whatever it was had to be around 10 feet tall. We stood there frozen in fear as the screeching echoed in the distance while it disappeared into the forest.

The experience made us want to figure out what it was. The next day we decided to walk through the woods during daylight to see if we could find anything. As we got deep into the woods we heard the screech again. We looked toward the sound and saw a tall black figure hiding behind a tree. We panicked and ran as fast as we could.

m61k75b,Recent-Enthusiasm970,"I am from a country in the Pacific called Papua New Guinea. And these happened in 1997 when I was just 15 years old. It was during the school holidays and I had just traveled to my home village which is pretty remote and rural. 

We had a special feast so during the week, the women went to the gardens to prepare organic food like sweet potatoes, taros, casava and the men and young boys would go out hunting for pigs and cuscus which is like a possum in Australia and has tasty meat. 

So my uncle took a couple of cousins of mine and myself to go hunting and since I came from the city they wanted me to experience the village life of hunting. We went into the tropical jungle led by my uncle with other hunting parties as well. However my uncle decided to take us further and deeper into the jungle away from the other hunting parties and about noon we came across our sacred ancestral grounds which the elders always warn us not to go there. At that time I did not know that it was a sacred ancient ground. 

The place had old clay pots and fireplace which was untouched and some of my cousins started messing around with this things. We started walking but to our suprise we found ourselves walking back to the same place where the claypots and fireplace were. At first we did not notice anything strange but as we kept walking we kept coming back to the same spot  for like the fourth time and began realising that something strange was happening to us. We were walking in circles and we were all alone from the rest of the hunting parties. We tried walking again and kept returning back to the same place for almost an hour. I was terrified and scared with tears rolling down my eyes. Everyone was panicked with fear, we were lost and confused by the spirits of that old ancient sacred ground and they were not letting us go. 

But for some reason my uncle remembered an old saying by our elders that if you get lost in the deep jungles, always find a stream or creek and it will lead you to the rivers and to familiar grounds. He then took us downhill as we were up on the mountain where the ancient sacred ground was by cutting through rough edges, bushes and thorns with a machete until we found a stream below and followed it eventually finding our way back to the main river and to our village.

I was doing my usual routine of walking around town for a few hours as I enjoyed walking and I was getting my steps in for the day. I‚Äôd always start from my house, walk around town for a few hours then turn around and head back home. I‚Äôd always go walking around noon or an hour or two later at the latest. My walks would start at 11AM at the earliest or 2PM at the latest. 

This day in particular, I had a bunch of things to do so I was unable to go out walking before noon. I‚Äôd eventually finished up everything that I needed to do but it was already in the mid to late afternoon. I checked the time and it was almost 3PM. I debated whether or not if I should go walking or if I should go tomorrow instead since I had nothing going on the next day. I said fuck it and decided to go for my walk but I told myself that I had to cut it short since I didn‚Äôt want to be out after sunset since it would get pretty cold at night. 

I got dressed and headed out to get my walk in for the day. Fast forward almost three hours later, I looked at my phone to check the time, saw that it was almost 6PM and started to make my way back home. I had a bit of a problem which was I was about 6 miles away from my house and it would take me about an hour and a half or more to get there. The sun had fully gone down and there was only a faint orange glow in the sky from it. The night sky had begun to take over and the air was turning cold. I began to make my way home and had picked up the pace as I didn‚Äôt want to be outside when it was cold. 

I was about two miles away from my home and thought I was in the clear when I was wrong. I passed by a convenient store when I noticed a man sitting on the side of the building smoking a cigarette. The man looked to be in his early to mid thirties, wore a black hoodie, black pants, and black shoes. I saw him turn his head towards me and he gave me a blank stare. I thought nothing of it and just ignored it. I turned around a few moments later and saw he had gotten up from his spot and began walking the same direction I was going. I kept checking behind me often to see if he would turn down another street but he never did. After several minutes of him walking the same way as me, I hear the man start yelling ‚Äúhey‚Äù. He then started saying other stuff to try to get my attention which I ignored. Right after that, I heard him yell ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù at me in an angry tone. I sped up and didn‚Äôt dare to look back at that point. 

I texted my dad and explained that there‚Äôs some creepy guy following me and how he was yelling at me. My dad replies asking me how far I am and I say about less than a mile away. He replies back that to keep walking, don‚Äôt worry, and that he‚Äôll come and get me in the next few minutes. I turned behind me to see if he‚Äôs still following as he stopped yelling and he was unfortunately. I was 3/4 of a mile away from my house and I thought about just running there. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt want this guy to follow me and find out where I lived. 

I was about to turn down the street I lived at when something told me not to. I texted my dad and told him I passed the street and to go the other way which he replied with ok. I kept going forward passing the street when all of a sudden I heard some kind of frantic noise. I turned around only to see to my horror that the guy put his hood up and was sprinting straight towards me. Without hesitation, I bolted straight ahead and ran across the street. I kept running for what felt like hours until I saw a pair of headlights coming down the street. I waved my arms like a madman hoping they would see me. Thankfully they did and the car stopped. I got closer and saw it was my dad. I looked behind me only to see that the man who was chasing me had somehow disappeared. 

I got in the car and explained everything to him. He said that he was going to drive down the street to see if he could find the man and would confront him. We drove down the street only to see nobody walking on the side walk or hiding behind the bushes. There was no sign of anyone being out as the streets were empty.

When I got to the house the lights were on, which was kinda weird but I figured I probably just forgot to turn them off after I left the other day. I walk into the kitchen and the drawers and cabinets are all open, which was also kinda weird. Then it hit me, *ALL of the cabinets and drawers were open, and ALL of the lights were on in the house.* As this realization washed over me I noticed muddy footprints all over the kitchen floor. At that point I ran out to my car, checked the backseat then drove off. I called all of my roommates, but none of them had been to the house since moving out.


I contacted the police, and they came out to the house and did a walkthrough with me. Nobody was in the house, and we found the entry point as one of the bedroom windows, and they broke through the window screen leaving heavy muddy footprints by the window. We had a wooden privacy fence in the back yard, and 2 of the boards had been ripped off and footprints went from there to the bedroom window.

You'd open the door it would immediately stop(still only had the 1 cat) or there was a handful of times it would sound like someone took the dresser changing table combo in their room and threw it across the floor but nothing would be changed or moved when we'd go in.

m620cyn,Hopeful_Cranberry635,"I have many, but I‚Äôll focus on one that has always stuck with me. When I was in early elementary school, I lived in a really bad area that could be defined as ‚Äúthe hood‚Äù, and my neighborhood happened to be plagued by constant deaths. One day, when I was 6 or 7, I came home from school to discover that one of the townhouses across from my apartment complex was surrounded by FBI agents and caution tape, amongst other law enforcement.

I asked my mom ‚Äúwhy are all the police here?‚Äù And my mom had basically told me that a guy had killed someone. I later learned that the guy was an older army recruiter who had a 17 year old girlfriend, and some kind of dispute happened in that house that led to him shooting the 17 year old girl and then turning the gun on himself. They both died. It was all really tragic but creepy at the same time, and my neighborhood never felt the same afterwards. I swear every time I walked past that house, the energies would change.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I lived in such a seedy area or if the neighborhood was just cursed, but after all of this happened, I saw many more incidents happen there until we moved states. There were at least 2-3 different instances in which I had to see people in body bags. I was just a kid too. I‚Äôm so glad I don‚Äôt live there anymore.",4,1736347678.0,1hwbx6g

I was also distracted because I was on the phone with my friend recapping the evening. Right when I got to the front door of my building somebody grabbed me from behind and tried to drag me down the stairs towards the street. A neighbor in front must have heard the commotion and or randomly just turned on their lights at that moment and the guy ran off into a crummy looking van and took off down the street. 

A couple of days later, I saw that another woman in my neighborhood had been abducted by a person with the same vehicle, raped and left in a field in a nearby county.",4,1736348003.0,1hwbx6g

The fish doesn't think about it or notice it, because it's always experiencing it -- it doesn't feel important because it is ever-present, and because it seems so basic it's hard to recognize as ""culture.""

As a result, I think most people would say that it matters to them very little, primarily because they overestimate how universal their culture is. I think the main exceptions fall into two categories:

* Minorities who are constantly reminded that their culture is *not* the dominant culture, and therefore have to spend time thinking about it and how much / whether they value it. E.g., I'm Jewish... We have our own language, holidays, religion, philosophy, laws, customs, food, and so on. We've been a minority for so long that if it weren't important to us, we wouldn't exist anymore.

I often forgot about it and lowkey assumed that I was white or ""like"" most of my friends and classmates. I grew up super white.

The building itself was [an Army Barracks Hospital](https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.ny1864.photos/?sp=22&st=text) originally built at the end of the 1800s, and then eventually used as a mental health facility through I think the 70s or early 80s.
  
I'm pretty sure my dad's co-worker talked him into it, because he didn't really do things like this. It was just his co-worker and his young kid, my parents and siblings, and my best friend of 3 years who was spending the night seeing that this was our last day together before I moved away.
  
Us kids were all 10 years or younger, and while I don't think the facility ever really had any sort of dark of violent history, it still contained a lot of the furniture and even some medical devices from the 60s-70s or earlier which made it just as spooky. I remember running down the long dark halls getting flashes of the empty rooms on either side with the occasional steel bed frame or pile of broken furniture and imagining I saw glimpses of figures in the rooms.  
  
Hell of a memorable way to say goodbye to my friend and upstate of New York.

The top officers got to live in the old brick homes that lined the opposite side of the oval from the hospital and admin buildings. I remember we were invited to a fancy Christmas party held at one of them and they all had these original brick structures out front by the street that were designed to make mounting horses easier. It was just a cool base overall. There was this old abandoned wooden house just sitting in the middle of nowhere, that was a historic landmark because Grant had slept there once. We couldn't explore it because the house was closed off due to its condition, but it was just cool that a hike from base housing to where the main shopping area was took you by this place and at least 1 old Graveyard dating back to the early 19th Century.

It's still a relationship. All relationships require some level of effort and maintenance and some trajectory of growth. If you, your partner, or both of you give up on the relationship, then the relationship begins to erode immediately.

This is what my awkward, bookish cousin was told by her parents all through her teens/early 20s. This girl was riddled with social anxiety, she didn't need anyone encouraging her to stay home and read/play video games.

When we became roommates, in college, I told her a guy wasn't just going to fall into her lap. At least not one looking for a relationship. She had to get out there and meet someone.

Then I was partnered with this random girl in Sociology 101. And she stopped by my apartment to give me her part of the presentation we were putting together. She brought her brother along and, during the 15 minutes we spent going over her notes, her brother hung out with my cousin.

They are now madly in love.

Knowledge is awesome. Get comfy. Shift you position regularly. Have a snack and/or a cup of tea. Put on some music you like, but nothing too distracting, of course.

Try different methods of memorization and see which one suits you the best. I love taking notes and bringing them in order, using highlighters and stuff. During the exam I had the image of the page before my inner eye and I could basically read from it. (Writing by hand is better than typing.) Rhythm is a good thing, too. A classmate memorized stuff by connecting it to a song she listened to while studying. It was all gone after the exam, tho.

Take breaks. Pomodoro says 25 mins of focus, 5-10 mins break. During breaks, move. Stretch, walk around, wiggle your fingers. Look out the windows, have your eyes focus on something far away (50 m or more).

I typically prefer studying alone, but maybe find a friend/classmate/roommate who couldn't get away fast enough and study together. Explain things to each other, ask questions, even if they appear basic.

For speedy process, heat it slightly, but do not forget about it. The sticky charred mass will turn into goo and detach from the surface. Wash with water, do not touch it. Then scrub if anything is left, it should be very easy.

The reason I ""almost don't want to share it"" is that lye is dangerous if used improperly. Cold solution will hardly hurt your skin, but can make you blind.

m5y197e,genghis-san,"I was thinking about what I need to be happy, and came to the conclusion that I need 3 hobbies: one creative, one physical, and one social.

For social, I do board game nights weekly. This ensures I have something planned for the week to look forward to.

For physical, I go to the gym, which to be honest I hate and have always hated, so I took up bouldering too. This is a great hobby because it can also be very social, and it's also just fun. 

And for creative, I dabble in things like drawing, knitting, and other needlework. I also throw in reading here too, because it can make you think and imagine. If you play D&D, this can also combine with social.

I've been extremely happy since figuring out for myself. I've always had a list of hobbies I want to try, but this helps me organize them. The only reason I'd hate to share it is so certain spaces don't get overcrowded lol but usually the more the merrier!",1114,1736286797.0,1hvqz4d

m5yo6st,HipHopopotamus10,"For public speaking where you have to look competent and relaxed but you may be nervous:

While you're waiting to go on, force yourself to yawn. You'll look relaxed to those around you and it does signal to your body that you're OK. We tend not to yawn when we're in danger. It's also a sneaky way of taking a really deep breath. 

If you're one of the people who can do this on command and not look cross eyed, blur your eyes while you're speaking. It makes the audience become an indistinct mass. 

If your hands shake, hold something in your hand - not paper! That will make it worse and more visible. But a pen, or something you can grip which will stop your hand from shaking. You can also lean on a desk or podium.

If you're voice starts to shake, cough, clear your throat, and take a sip of water. Then you can say ""sorry about that"". It gives you a chance to reset and take a deep breath. People feed off your nervousness and if you ignore the fact that your voice is shaking, it can be uncomfortable for everyone. People (including you) will be much more comfortable if it was just something in your throat.. If you find yourself breathless or needing a drink or deep breath, just do it. It feels like a huge pause to you but it's not. Taking pauses shows confidence. But if you're really uncomfortable, feign technical difficulties like a slide not switching and give yourself a chance to take a breath while you ""figure it out"". 

Most important tip: Practice! That means keeping on making yourself do it, even if it's scary. But it also means practicing in the car, or when you're alone. If you have a particular presentation you need to do that's high pressure, do it over and over, write it out or even record yourself saying it and listen to it on repeat. Eventually you won't need to do that as you get more confident, but it's useful for as long as you need it. It's crazy how many people think they don't need to practice public speaking and should be able to just do it because they can speak in regular conversations. It's a skill. The more your practice, the better it will be.",51,1736293981.0,1hvqz4d

m627yop,am_i_boy,"Yeah. I have been with disabled people before, and I myself have also been disabled at some point (it's a dynamic disability caused by a chronic condition so if I get a flare up that bad it's very possible I will be disabled again). My disability was mobility related (I was using a walker for very short distances and not able to travel long distances at all when it was at its worst) and I genuinely had no problems finding people to have sex with. Sex does get a bit more complicated as you have to figure out what positions can work for you without exacerbating your pain, how long you can stay in one position, how long you can go on for before you exhaust yourself, etc. and there's plenty of people not willing to put in that much effort for sex. 

The other disabled people I have been with are mainly people with severe chronic pain related conditions. It's happened several times where we had to completely stop sex and spend some time caring for my then-partner's pain when it got triggered. 

I noticed in my own life that I'm more likely to be physically intimate without being sexually intimate if I'm in a flare up and the same has been true for the other disabled people I've been with. While my libido doesn't decrease and I remain very horny despite the flare up, sometimes my body just couldn't handle sex.

m5z5sjz,munificent,"**1. Get out of the house.**

Think about how zoos keep animals healthy. Do they have them just sitting in a tiny rectangular enclosure motionless all day? Hell, no! Animals evolved to explore and interact with the physical world. We're animals too. We're happiest when we are out there doing stuff. We need enrichment activities as much as bears do.

**2. Get off screens.**

See above. It's not enough to *see* the larger world. We need to be physically present and interacting with it. Likewise, it's not enough to just watch videos of people. We need to actually connect with them.

**3. Do the right thing.**

So much of ""boredom"" and ""depression"" is really *avoidance* and *anxiety*. Your conscience is telling you to do something difficult but important: exercise for your health, be a little vulnerable and call that person you have a crush on, go to a town hall and try to make a difference in your community, etc. But these things have risks and are scary.

So‚Äîand we all do this to one degree or another‚Äîwe avoid and procrastinate. One way we rationalize it to ourselves is that we don't have enough ""energy"" to do what we know is right and instead do some ""self care"". But often that lack of energy is because we're drained from the angel on one shoulder battling the demon on the other.

Let the angel win and do the right thing even if it's scary or hard and you'll be surprised how energized you feel afterwards.",23,1736299789.0,1hw4eg4

\- Everything is too expensive

\- Most food here is basically considered poison outside the US (artificial colors/flavors, insane amounts of sugar, etc)

\- We have a terrible culture of ""self-reliance"" but ignore the fact that society itself relies on others

\- No Universal Healthcare

\- Half the country doesn't believe reality and neither half agree which half that is

\- Everything is crumbling around us and no one seems to be particularly concerned: Climate Change, infrastructure, social safety nets, family structures, friends

\- We're tired boss. There's a million new bad news stories every day, there's no good way to filter it, and generally the entire planet seems to be going in the wrong direction

\- The US is officially going to be an Oligarchy now (I mean, it's not like it wasn't before but now the entire cabinet is packed with billionaires/100's of millionaires so it's much more obvious).

I'm one of the more fortunate people I know. Most of my family are too poor to comfortably LIVE, much less thrive.

Higher your dopamine intake, the more it takes to satisfy your life, then you develop depression because you are unsatisfied with life.¬†There's a reason why depression increased with dopamine related technology (phones, porn, fast food, media, etc.)


Think of it like this; if you eat a chocolate bar every day for a year, by the end of the year you won't even be enjoying it anymore. Now, if you haven't had a chocolate bar in an entire year, by the time you eat it, it will be the best thing you've ever had.¬†


Statistically people tend to be happier with stuff like walks, parks, natures. Etc. All low dopamine related. It goes hand in hand.¬†The more you intake dopamine, the less it effects you. It's really an addiction, depression is just a dopamine addiction.¬†


Now, there are either factors that play into it aswell, but this is the bottom line. Change your dopamine intake, the rest will work itself out.¬†


Delete social media, stop eating fast food, stop binge watching shows. Go outside, excessive, be productive. We as humans are meant to work, it's why we have opposibe thumbs and intelligent minds.

m5xvu9b,DankgisKhan,"As someone has lived, worked, and spent what I'd consider livable time in nearly a dozen countries across Europe and North America, this is an impossible question to answer, because:

1) Inflation is a global phenomenon. Working class people are feeling the squeeze, everywhere. This has immense psychological effects on the working class no matter where you are.

2) it's impossible for a country to be doing great by every measure. For example, the Nordic countries win the top 5 in virtually all the development indices and their governments function very well. But the culture of these places has caused several different types of less measurable social problems - for example, less social cohesion, declining birth rates, and a considerable increase in depression in young people, compared to prior generations.

What is ""doing great"" by your standards? Great economically? Great socially? Great at everything?

Again, of the nearly dozen countries I have spent considerable time in, there was not a single one that I would say is ""doing great."" The world is a pile of shit right now, especially if you are working class.",2678,1736285231.0,1hvyz2s

Talking about Estonia: it is probably the world's most advanced nation in terms of digitalization. Despite its tiny population, it has a solid public transport (especially the rail sector made huge progresses). Rail Baltica will provide even more benefits. Besides that, the country is very well organized, infrastructure has been upgraded and modernized massively. The country has a solid tourism sector and a booming digital industry. The country is safe and running rsther smoothly.

Similar things can be said about Lithuania and Latvia as well. Of course, the developments are not identical but the tendency is similar. And again, Rail Baltica promises a MASSIVE benefit to all three countries.

Sure, each country has its flaws. Inflation, energy independency, and housing is also affecting the Baltics. Especially the last point is critical to me: the major cities (mainly Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius) are already somehow having problems with housing prices. Mainly due to gentrification and orientation towards touristic use. In my opinion, this might be one of the crucial aspects they have to take care off in order to avoid Lisbon-ization.

To be honest, I believe that the only major aspect potentially fucking things up in the Baltics is Russia. Hopefully, the protection of EU and NATO membership will last and be sufficient to avoid any further Russian interventions.",124,1736287126.0,1hvyz2s

m5ywna0,Final7C,"Most people are just doing what they can every day to survive. Some people have a bit more control over other peoples lives for a short amount of time. Most people are not really in much control over their lives. 

They can control probably 3 things. 

1.) Self harm

2.) Their own outlook on life

3.) Their expectations of others

99% of people who people believe are trying to fuck the world or are out to get you, are literally trying to do the least amount of work, to keep their boss, or keys to power happy. 

There are one or two people with power, but their power really are only those three things, and they have the ability to control a little bit of it. World leaders have to answer to congress, a military, a judge. The rich and famous have to answer to social norms, the law (to some extent) and their managers. The really rich have to answer to whomever gives them their money, and the laws of nature. 

Corporations have to answer to share holders, but luckily their only driving statement is to survive and make the most money possible. 

People usually think about themselves. How do I look to others? How do I get my needs met? How do I fit in? How do I live without you? Does anyone see me? You'd be shocked at just how little most people think about others. 

Everyone trades on something they have. Perhaps they are attractive, perhaps they are clever, perhaps they have money, perhaps they are hardworking, Perhaps they are faster than others, perhaps they are funny. We exchange those things for influence and power over particular people or groups. 

Most of life is the random chance mixed with a bit of genetic lottery. 

Some people are born rich, some are born poor, some people are born in the ethnic majority, Some are born in the ethnic minority, Some are born male, Some are born female, some are born both.   Some are born to two parents, some are born to one or none. Some are born healthy, and some are born diseased/disfigured/not whole, Some are born into family that loves and protects them, and some are born into a family that doesn't. All of these come with their own inherent advantages or disadvantages. Most people who are born with advantages don't see them, because as much as we think about ourselves, we are fish in water. We don't notice it. And it's only when comparing ourselves to others do we notice it. And we are often blinded by our gifts that we don't see others missing them. 

This creates a strong ""They don't deserve this"" mentality. That only truly people who have empathized with other people can fight. 

We all live in tribes. Tribes of our own selection and some that we are born into. We are indoctrinated our entire lives to either love this tribe, or be kicked out of it. Churches are tribes, Political parties are tribes, Employers, Families, Sporting Clubs, and Governments are all tribes. 

Anyone and anything can be bought for the right price. Anything that doesn't break the laws of physics can be done for the right price. 

Everyone is the summation of Luck+Genetic Lottery+Personal Choices. And no one quite knows how much of each of those variables made them. Most people honestly believe Personal Choices is the majority. 

Most people are one bad day away from losing everything they've ever done/strived for. 

Most people, just want to get laid by someone who isn't demanding too much effort on their part to do so.",6,1736296753.0,1hw44zz

m5z0oen,drewthetrue,"There are things with masses made of materials with names we can all recognize. We try to afford some of these things and others are disgusting and hideous. Drinks and bank accounts deplete. We replenish things. Humans tend to work. Animals forage. We're all born against our wills. Some things get deeper and some things are the deeper. If we could wire our brains to computers and record our thoughts we'd know new things. Perfect data exists like what the lottery will be for every drawing. Something could access the predictions for that. Granted there's a really near zero probability we could build that something. But there's all sorts of data and video grids that we can't access depicting extraordinary perspectives and knowledge. Like blood protein levels and real time body stats changing with time for everybody. Questions like ""What is everybody blind to"" have real long answers that we never read but we can only see a hint at. A lot of waste and chaos happens but most people complete their job daily to earn their pay. So mostly we rest knowing the day was a success. But what's hidden would reveal (and is) a lot more. We should try to imagine it. We aren't trying our hardest. There are losses we can prevent. It would be very entertaining to watch a video about how the world works. The camera could switch in and out of whoever's lives however you want, or in proportion to how important their careers are to the world.",1,1736298078.0,1hw44zz

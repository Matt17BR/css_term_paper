In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:\\n\\nhttps://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(25)00009-1\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nChronic pain is a leading cause of disability, affecting more women than men. Different immune cells contribute to this sexual divergence, but the mechanisms, especially in females, are not well defined. We show that pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels on microglia and T cells differentially cause mechanical allodynia, a debilitating symptom of neuropathic pain. In male rodents, Panx1 drives vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) release from microglia. Cell-specific knockdown of microglial Panx1 or pharmacological blockade of the VEGF receptor attenuated allodynia in nerve-injured males. In females, nerve injury increased spinal CD8+ T cells and leptin levels. Leptin release from female-derived CD8+ T cells was Panx1 dependent, and intrathecal leptin-neutralizing antibody injection sex-specifically reversed allodynia. Adoptive transfer of female-derived CD8+ T cells caused robust allodynia, which was prevented by a leptin-neutralizing antibody or leptin small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown. Panx1-targeted approaches may alleviate neuropathic pain in both sexes, while T cell- and leptin-directed treatments could have sex-dependent benefits for women.\\n\\nFrom the linked article:\\n\\nWhy pain medication may not be as effective for women as it is for men\\n\\nUCalgary researchers reveal biological differences between the sexes when it comes to chronic pain\\n\\nA new study led by University of Calgary professor Dr. Tuan Trang, PhD, may help to explain why there is an over-representation of women experiencing chronic pain compared to men. In 2019, the Canadian Pain Task Force report found chronic pain is more common among females of all ages, including children, when compared to males.\\n\\n“Both males and females develop pain, but each sex develops it through different means,” says Trang, a professor in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and Cumming School of Medicine (CSM). “This study identifies a very unique type of biological process through a specific immune cell that is distinctive to each sex.”\\n\\nThe study, published in Neuron, focused on neuropathic pain, which is caused by injury to a nerve or the nervous system. A debilitating symptom of this is allodynia which is experienced when someone feels pain from a stimulus that does not typically cause pain. This condition can be very hard to treat; for instance, things like a light touch, temperature changes, and clothing against the skin can be agonizing. The study, conducted in rats and mice, found that in both sexes pain signals can be communicated by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels but through different types of immune cells. In female rodents, however, activation of Panx1 releases leptin, a hormone which has been associated with heightened pain sensitivity.', 'comment_score': 41, 'comment_created_utc': 1742557214.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgerd9'}, {'comment_id': 'miypm4w', 'comment_author': 'Jedi_Outcast_Reborn', 'comment_body': \"Doesn't this indicate that these pain drugs were developed for men, and that we need to invest in better development for drugs for women?\", 'comment_score': 173, 'comment_created_utc': 1742560636.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgerd9'}, {'comment_id': 'mizf3bo', 'comment_author': 'PennilessPirate', 'comment_body': '95% of drugs are developed for men.

In addition to recording the total area covered by all tree clusters, they also identified the proximity and connectedness of tree clusters, their geometrical complexity and the fragmentation level.\\n\\nThey linked this information with the survival time of the resident in the respective neighbourhood for over six million adults, i.e.\\xa0looking exclusively at natural-cause deaths due to illness and old age. This data, supplied by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, covers over a ten-year period (2010–2019). In order to protect privacy, the Federal Statistical Office rounded the coordinates of citizens’ residences to the nearest 50 metres.\\n\\n**Tree quantity and positioning both matter**\\n\\nData analysis shows that both the tree canopy cover in residential areas and their spatial arrangement correlate with mortality. The study identified a significantly lower mortality risk in people who live in neighbourhoods with large, contiguous and well networked areas of tree canopies than for people who live in areas with fewer, fragmented areas of tree canopies with complex geometries. This correlation is particularly evident in densely developed peri-urban and urban areas with poor air quality and high temperatures: if such areas feature well-structured forested green spaces, the residents may receive more health benefits than other areas.\\n\\nYet, while this study represents an important first step, it is still not possible to draw conclusions regarding the causes. The researchers are not yet able to state with precision the pathways through which tree canopy configuration influences human health.

The study found that while male infants tend to have larger total brain volumes, female infants, when adjusted for brain size, have more grey matter, whereas male infants have more white matter. These findings suggest that prenatal biological factors play a significant role in shaping early sex differences in brain structure.\\n\\nThe findings confirmed that male infants had larger total brain volumes compared to female infants, a pattern that has been consistently reported in older children and adults. However, when researchers adjusted for overall brain size, they found that female infants had significantly more grey matter, while male infants had more white matter.\\n\\nFurther analysis of specific brain regions showed that, even after accounting for differences in total brain volume, certain areas were larger in female infants, while others were larger in male infants. Female infants had relatively greater volumes in regions such as the corpus callosum, which connects the two hemispheres of the brain, and the parahippocampal gyrus, an area involved in memory processing. Male infants had larger volumes in regions such as the medial and inferior temporal gyri, which are associated with visual and auditory processing.', 'comment_score': 856, 'comment_created_utc': 1742491492.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfu8nz'}, {'comment_id': 'miu7wyl', 'comment_author': 'ishka_uisce', 'comment_body': 'As must be pointed out repeatedly with this sort of research, because people seem incapable of grasping it, these differences are *averages*, and often pretty small.

In a study [published](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347225000314?dgcid=coauthor) February 19 in Animal Behaviour, a team of researchers from the UW and Carnegie Mellon University have discovered the reason: They’re mimicking males. That trickery results in reduced aggression from other hummingbirds and increased access to nectar resources. \\n\\n“This research takes a mental model we’ve been describing for a while in our papers and gives it a mathematical backbone,” said Jay Falk, an evolutionary biologist who led this research while working as a postdoctoral scholar in the UW biology department. “It can be easy to think of natural selection as a force that is constantly choosing one single optimum. But this model adds to our understanding of how diversity, especially diversity within sexes, can be a stable endgame.” \\n\\nRelying on the principles of game theory and incorporating previously collected behavioral data, the researchers developed a model of hummingbird behavior to better understand how some birds choose their colors. The findings showed that “hybrid signals” — an equilibrium that can occur when signalers in a given situation may be dishonest — likely exist in nature.  \\n\\n“In these hummingbirds, females want to mimic males,” said Kevin Zollman, a co-author of the study and director of Carnegie Mellon’s Institute for Complex Social Dynamics. “If they all did that, then they would end up being disbelieved.

Previous findings suggest citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates are changing because of the patent for citalopram ending as opposed to evidence of a clear therapeutic advantage-so-called \"evergreening\". This retrospective study focuses on characterizing the chronologic and geographic variation in the use of citalopram and escitalopram from 2015 to 2020 among US Medicaid and Medicare patients. We hypothesized that prescription rates of citalopram will decrease with a concurrent increase in escitalopram, consistent with \"evergreening\".\\n\\n**Methods:**\\xa0Citalopram and escitalopram prescription rates and costs per state were obtained from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Database and Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data. States\\' annual prescription rates outside a 95% confidence interval were considered significantly different from the average.\\n\\n**Results:**\\xa0Overall, a decreasing trend for citalopram and an increasing trend for escitalopram prescription rates were noted in both Medicare and Medicaid patients. The differences between generic and brand were noted for both drugs, with generic forms being less expensive than the brand-name version.\\n\\n**Discussion:**\\xa0Despite limited evidence suggesting that citalopram and escitalopram have any meaningful differences in therapeutic or adverse effects, there exists a noticeable decline in the use of citalopram that cooccurred with an increase in escitalopram prescribing, consistent with our hypothesis. Moreover, among these general pharmacoepidemiologic trends exists significant geographic variability. There was disproportionate spending (relative to their use) on the brand versions of these medicines relative to their generic forms.\\n\\n**Disclosure #1**: This study received no external funding.\\n\\n**Disclosure #2**: I\\'m a co-author.', 'comment_score': 3, 'comment_created_utc': 1742572770.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jgk5dn'}, {'comment_id': 'mizvisa', 'comment_author': 'kalilza', 'comment_body': 'I would be curious what the trend would look like if you extend out the data to 2010.

The findings suggest – for the first time in a clinical trial – that early treatment to remove amyloid plaques from the brain many years before symptoms arise can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s dementia.\\n\\nThe study is published March 19 in The Lancet Neurology.\\n\\nThe international study involved 73 people with rare, inherited genetic mutations that cause the overproduction of amyloid in the brain, all but guaranteeing that they will develop Alzheimer’s disease in middle age. For a subgroup of 22 participants who had no cognitive problems at the study’s start and who received the drug the longest – an average of eight years – the treatment lowered the risk of developing symptoms from essentially 100% to about 50%, according to a primary analysis of the data and supported by multiple sensitivity analyses supporting the trend. \\n\\nThe findings provide new evidence to support the so-called amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease, which posits that the first step on the road to dementia is the build-up of amyloid plaques in the brain, and that removing such plaques or blocking their formation can stop symptoms from arising. For this study, Bateman and colleagues evaluated the effects of an experimental anti-amyloid drug to see if the medication could prevent the development of dementia.', 'comment_score': 188, 'comment_created_utc': 1742435634.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfe1zz'}, {'comment_id': 'miqc82r', 'comment_author': 'Last-Initial3927', 'comment_body': 'Hold the phone.

Amyloid does not have to be the direct cause of impairment to be an important part of the disease process and is in fact believed to be the first major (easily measurable) change in the neuropathological cascade that leads to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. However, once someone has symptomatic AD, they are towards the end of the disease process and no pharmaceutical can reverse brain damage.

In Romania, where traditional diets are heavily dependent on animal-based products, optimizing land use is critical. This study investigates the potential of plant-based diets to reduce agricultural land use, examining scenarios of partial and complete replacement of animal protein with plant protein sources (soy, peas, and potatoes). Methods: The research modeled three dietary transition scenarios—replacing 33%, 50%, and 100% of animal protein with plant-based protein—using data from the Romanian National Institute of Statistics, the FAO, and international sources. Land use was calculated for each scenario using formulas that take into account protein content and land use intensity for animal and plant protein sources. The simulations quantify the reduction in agricultural land use at the per capita and national levels. Results: The study reveals significant land-saving potential across all scenarios. At the national level, land use reductions ranged from 84,020 hectares (33% replacement) to **1,067,443 hectares** (100% replacement). High-impact products such as beef and dairy continue to dominate land use, even in partial replacement scenarios. Conversely, replacing pork and chicken proteins shows substantial savings. The findings highlight the inefficiency of animal-based protein production and the ecological benefits of transitioning to plant-based diets. Conclusions: **A dietary shift towards plant-based protein in Romania could achieve significant reductions in agricultural land use**, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals. This transition not only supports environmental conservation and resource optimization, but also provides public health benefits by reducing consumption of red and processed meat.

At the societal level, there is a longstanding debate about the role of political extremes in social movements.

My colleagues and I wanted to examine the influence of both ideological values and a more cognitive feature of one’s ideological position (i.e., extremism) in political investment and, in this study, collective action. Our research is based on the premise that values and beliefs indeed play a major role in political behavior.

Different areas of the brain are involved in determining the meaning that's desired, finding the words to express it, and then converting those words to a specific series of sounds—and all that comes before the correct sequence of nerve impulses is sent to the muscles that produce the final output. Humans are far from alone in the animal kingdom with an impressive range of vocalizations, though. That raises the prospect that we can understand a bit more about our own speech by studying how vocalization is managed in different animals.\\n\\nOne group of species that's especially interesting is birds. They're distant relatives compared to other animals with interesting vocal capabilities, like whales and elephants, and their brains have some notable differences from ours. They also show a range of behaviors, from complex songs to vocal mimicry to whatever it is that you want to call what parrots do. Thanks to a newly released study, however, we now have evidence that these different types of vocalization are the product of different control systems in the brain.\\n\\n[The study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08695-8) relied on electrodes placed in the brains of parrots and songbirds and tracked the behavior of neurons in a region that controls vocalization. It showed that the two relied on different types of control, with parrots having a system that operates similarly to the one used by humans.\\n\\nThe work focused on two species of birds. One is the zebra finch, a songbird that learns to produce a short song it uses each year, in part by listening to what its peers are singing. The second is the budgerigar, a small parrot that's often kept as a pet. Budgerigars are both impressive vocal mimics and also have complex vocalizations called warbles that are a mix of noisy and harmonic calls.\\n\\nDue to past work, we've already identified the brain structure that controls the activity of the key vocal organ, the syrinx, located in the bird's throat. The new study, done by Zetian Yang and Michael Long of New York University, managed to place fine electrodes into this area of the brain in both species and track the activity of neurons there while the birds were awake and going about normal activities. This allowed them to associate neural activity with any vocalizations made by the birds. For the budgerigars, they had an average of over 1,000 calls from each of the four birds carrying the implanted electrodes.\", 'comment_score': 19, 'comment_created_utc': 1742432892.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfd5cz'}, {'comment_id': 'miqb70m', 'comment_author': 'CornWallacedaGeneral', 'comment_body': 'The mighty parakeet I love these guys!', 'comment_score': 7, 'comment_created_utc': 1742437053.0, 'comment_level': 2, 'parent_id': 'mipz9rj', 'post_id': '1jfd5cz'}, {'comment_id': 'miq86ks', 'comment_author': 'ostuberoes', 'comment_body': 'This write up is much much better than the other one posted earlier in this sub, which is downright shameful.', 'comment_score': 6, 'comment_created_utc': 1742435996.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jfd5cz'}]"

In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:\\n\\nhttps://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/02/bmjebm-2024-112974\\n\\nFrom the linked article: \\n\\nOnly 10% of non-surgical treatments for back problems kill pain, says review\\n\\nOnly six out of 56 treatments analysed yielded ‘small’ relief according to most comprehensive worldwide study, with some even increasing pain\\n\\nMost treatments for back pain do not work and even the few that do bring little relief, a global review of the evidence on one of the world’s commonest health problems has found.\\n\\nSix in 10 adults in the UK live with lower back pain at some point. Symptoms can include excruciating pain, restricted movement, inability to work and reluctance to mix socially. Some people feel better within weeks but others can find their life dominated by chronic pain for years.\\n\\nThe wide range of treatment available includes painkillers, acupuncture, stretching, massage, anti-inflammatory drugs, laser and light therapy, and manipulation of the spine.\\n\\nHowever, the bad news for the many who endure back pain is that only 10% of these non-surgical treatments usually deployed actually have any effect – and the rest provide little or no benefit.\\n\\nOnly six out of the 56 treatments analysed are effective and even those yield only “small” relief. The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.\\n\\nThat is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.\\n\\nAustralian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.\\n\\n“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.', 'comment_score': 1, 'comment_created_utc': 1742376463.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jet0pz'}, {'comment_id': 'milabr4', 'comment_author': 'LifeofTino', 'comment_body': 'Also worth noting that surgical treatments for back issues are also notorious for having a low success rate, with some studies finding surgical treatments to be less successful than non-surgical on average\\n\\nBack problems were also the canary in the mine around diagnostics.

And, just as famously, lots of scans showed people with significant issues (including bulged discs) that had zero pain, and people with a lot of pain with no diagnosable issues at all\\n\\nWhich led to diagnostic reforms, because if someone had an issue with something that had no scan indication, and also had something on the scan that wasn’t causing an issue, this would lead to a misdiagnosis and incorrect treatment. Which is partly the cause of such poor results when it comes to back issues\\n\\nSo, back issues are so well known for having incredibly poor treatment success across all healthcare that they have had major impacts on all therapy and diagnostic practices', 'comment_score': 1343, 'comment_created_utc': 1742377834.0, 'comment_level': 1, 'parent_id': None, 'post_id': '1jet0pz'}, {'comment_id': 'milg78r', 'comment_author': 'DangerousTurmeric', 'comment_body': \"Yeah I worked for a company that made spinal cord stimulators, which are basically a battery pack and some electrodes implanted in a person's back to run constant or phased electrical currents, as interference in the spinal cord to numb the pain.

They aimed to quantify changes in the prevalence and burden of mental disorders before and during the pandemic, providing a clearer picture of how young people were affected worldwide.\\n\\nThe researchers analyzed mental health data from 204 countries and territories, focusing on individuals aged 5 to 24. They examined three key measures: the number of new cases, the total number of people affected (prevalence), and the burden of mental disorders in terms of years lived with disability (YLDs).

But also, we're talking about a subset that actually goes to confession.  Most christians probably don't even go to church outside of christmas (they're supposed to go every week), let alone touch a confession booth (I don't remember, but I believe confession is supposed to be a thing they do every so often as well, at least for Catholics.  Don't ask me about the various protestant sects).

Likewise, the link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, COPD, etc., etc. is still technically \"just\" correlative because the data on humans is still just epidemiological, given we can't ethically perform randomized controlled trials on the subject.\n\nBut thanks to data—which started much like this study and over time became more and more specific and accurate and included variations that were more conclusively casual, like the cigarette tar on mice study—we are able to very, very confidently claim that smoking tobacco causes cancer and a variety of other health issues in humans even if we don't have direct observational data of such.\n\nStudies like this are always the first step in confirming or falsifying these kinds of links as being significant or not. This study alone may not be enough on its own for further funding, but it does start to build the case for further study.",

But also, we're talking about a subset that actually goes to confession.  Most christians probably don't even go to church outside of christmas (they're supposed to go every week), let alone touch a confession booth (I don't remember, but I believe confession is supposed to be a thing they do every so often as well, at least for Catholics.  Don't ask me about the various protestant sects).

But also, we're talking about a subset that actually goes to confession.  Most christians probably don't even go to church outside of christmas (they're supposed to go every week), let alone touch a confession booth (I don't remember, but I believe confession is supposed to be a thing they do every so often as well, at least for Catholics.  Don't ask me about the various protestant sects).  And while I would expect most who bother to go to at least act like they're taking it seriously, there's no doubt a lot of people with selective hearing issues.",

But I'd be willing to wager that the greater risk of stroke, heart disease etc, could be better linked to combustion related products from smoking than actual marijuana. \n\nI work at an AAU school in research admin submitting grant proposals, this study probably wouldn't hold up well as prelim data for further funding.",

Likewise, the link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, COPD, etc., etc. is still technically \"just\" correlative because the data on humans is still just epidemiological, given we can't ethically perform randomized controlled trials on the subject.\n\nBut thanks to data—which started much like this study and over time became more and more specific and accurate and included variations that were more conclusively casual, like the cigarette tar on mice study—we are able to very, very confidently claim that smoking tobacco causes cancer and a variety of other health issues in humans even if we don't have direct observational data of such.\n\nStudies like this are always the first step in confirming or falsifying these kinds of links as being significant or not.

But also, we're talking about a subset that actually goes to confession.  Most christians probably don't even go to church outside of christmas (they're supposed to go every week), let alone touch a confession booth (I don't remember, but I believe confession is supposed to be a thing they do every so often as well, at least for Catholics.  Don't ask me about the various protestant sects).  And while I would expect most who bother to go to at least act like they're taking it seriously, there's no doubt a lot of people with selective hearing issues.",

But also, we're talking about a subset that actually goes to confession.  Most christians probably don't even go to church outside of christmas (they're supposed to go every week), let alone touch a confession booth (I don't remember, but I believe confession is supposed to be a thing they do every so often as well, at least for Catholics.  Don't ask me about the various protestant sects).

It's a correlation, but it means nothing. \n\nNow, this correlation between marijuana and heart issues isn't as nonsense as that. But I'd be willing to wager that the greater risk of stroke, heart disease etc, could be better linked to combustion related products from smoking than actual marijuana. \n\nI work at an AAU school in research admin submitting grant proposals, this study probably wouldn't hold up well as prelim data for further funding.",

Likewise, the link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, COPD, etc., etc. is still technically \"just\" correlative because the data on humans is still just epidemiological, given we can't ethically perform randomized controlled trials on the subject.\n\nBut thanks to data—which started much like this study and over time became more and more specific and accurate and included variations that were more conclusively casual, like the cigarette tar on mice study—we are able to very, very confidently claim that smoking tobacco causes cancer and a variety of other health issues in humans even if we don't have direct observational data of such.\n\nStudies like this are always the first step in confirming or falsifying these kinds of links as being significant or not. This study alone may not be enough on its own for further funding, but it does start to build the case for further study.",

But also, we're talking about a subset that actually goes to confession.  Most christians probably don't even go to church outside of christmas (they're supposed to go every week), let alone touch a confession booth (I don't remember, but I believe confession is supposed to be a thing they do every so often as well, at least for Catholics.  Don't ask me about the various protestant sects).  And while I would expect most who bother to go to at least act like they're taking it seriously, there's no doubt a lot of people with selective hearing issues.",
